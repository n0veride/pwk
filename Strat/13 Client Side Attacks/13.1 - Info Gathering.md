### Passive Info Gathering: 
  
Do not directly interact w/ the targets.  
  
Can google for various known external corporate IP addresses.  
See if any are on a site that hosts collected user agent data from various affiliate sites.

	Revealed browser type, version, installed plugins, & underlying OS version of the corporate client machine.  
  
We can then mod & test an existing exploit against on of our lab machines running the same OS & browser version before initiating an attack.  
  
This info can be found fairly easily even on social media and forum websites. (engineer posting to Stack Overflow about an app version they're having probs w/)  
  
  
 
### Active Info Gathering:
  
Involves making direct contact w/ the machine or its users:  
Phone calls  
Phishing emails, etc  
  
  
  
### Social Engineering:  
  
Tactics to improve chances for attack success.  
  
**Pretexting:** Creating and using an invented scenario to engage the targeted victim in a manner that  
increases the chance they'll divulge info or perform actions that would be unlikely in normal/ ordinary circumstances.  
  
Ex: You send a malformed word doc (resume) to someone in HR.  
They email back saying they can't open it, so you mention it could be a version incompatibility, maybe ask about security features.  
(That there are Adv features like Macros to make it stand out & easy to navigate.)  
They tell you the version of Word they're using.  
You can now craft another doc w/ malicious macros that'll get you a reverse shell.  
  
  
  
### Client Fingerprinting:  
  
Note: [https://forums.offensive-security.com/showthread.php?38215-13-1-2-2-Client-Fingerprinting-Exerise-FIX](https://forums.offensive-security.com/showthread.php?38215-13-1-2-2-Client-Fingerprinting-Exerise-FIX)  
  
1. Info collected about the software and hardware of a remote computing device for the purpose of identification.  
2. Extremely critical to success of our attack.  
	- Must often attain from the machine itself  
  
Can be used to fully or partially ID individual devices even when persistent (and zombie) cookies  
can't be read or stored in the browser, the client IP is hidden, or one switches to another browser on the same device.  
May allow a service provider to detect & prevent ID theft & CC fraud, but also compiles long-term records of individuals' browsing histories  
for targeted advertising or targeted exploits.  
  
  
Many tools for fingerprinting, such as [fingerprintjs2](fingerprintjs2.md)'s JS library:  
```bash
cd /var/www/html  
mkdir fp  
  
wget https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2/archive/master.zip  
unzip master.zip  
mv fingerprintjs2-master/ fp  
  
cd fp  
  
vim index.html
```


We can craft a [website](fingerprintjs2.md) that, once visited, will gather all the data.  
  
Once a victim browses to the site, we can inspect the contents of **fingerprint.txt** on our attack server  
  
We can submit the discovered User Agent string to an online user agent database to ID the browser version & the OS
