Using a proper port scanning methodology can significantly improve efficiency while also limiting many of the risks.  
Depending on the scope of the engagement, start by only scanning for ports 80 and 443.  
With a list of possible web servers, run a full port scan against these servers in the background while performing other enumeration.  
  
  
_**TCP Port Scanning**_, called CONNECT scanning, relies on the [three-way TCP handshake](TCP%20-%203-Way%20Handshake.md) mechanism. If the handshake completes, the port's considered open.  
Takes longer than SYN scan, but doesn't require root privileges.  
  
[netcat](netcat.md), while _not_ a port scanner, can be used as one.  
  
Ex:  
```bash
nc -nvv -w 1 -z 10.11.1.220 3388-3390
```
	-n : Skip DNS name resolution  
	-vv : Very verbose  
	-w : Timeout after 1 second  
	-z : Don't send any data

_**UDP Port Scanning**_ uses a different mechanism as UDP is stateless.  
If the destination UDP port is open, the packet will be passed to the application layer and the response received will depend on how the application is programmed to respond to empty packets.  
However, if the destination UDP port is closed, the target should respond with an ICMP port unreachable, that is sent by the UDP/IP stack of the target machine.  
  
Ex:
```bash
nc -nv -u -z -w 1 10.11.1.115 160-162
```

_**[nmap](nmap.md)**_ for port scanning and network sweeping.  
  
Network sweeping w/ the **-sn** (ping sweep) option, the host discovery process consists of sending:  
• TCP SYN packet to port 443  
• TCP ACK packet to port 80  
• ICMP timestamp request  
  
Best to output results to a greppable format using **-oG** to a file  
Scanning a specific port/s across a network tends to be more accurate than a ping sweep (**-sn**)  
  
Save time and resources, scan multiple IPs for top ports:  
```bash
nmap -sT -A --top-ports=20 10.11.1.1-254 -oG top-port-sweep.txt
```
	**-sT** - Connect scan  
	**-A** - Aggressive scan: OS detection, traceroute, script scanning  
	**--top-ports** - Scans for given number (20) of top ports (determined within _/usr/share/nmap/nmap-services_)  
  
_**OS Fingerprinting**_ attempts to guess the target's OS version by inspecting return packets as OS's have slightly different implementations of their TCP/IP stack.  
Not always accurate - more like a best guess  
  
_**[Banner Grabbing](Banner_Grabbing.md)**_ _can_ help ID services by inspecting banners (use w/ **-sT -A**), however, as banners can be manipulated by sysadmins, beware w/ fake info.  
Has a significant impact on traffic amounts, so use wisely.
