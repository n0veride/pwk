When you [dot-source](https://ss64.com/ps/source.html), all variables and functions defined in the given script are loaded within the current [PowerShell](OS%20Commands.md#PowerShell) scope so they persist in the shell when the script ends.  
  
```powershell
. C:\scripts\myscript.ps1  
        OR  
. ./myscript.ps1
```
