Some supported scan types:  
• Basic Network Scan: Generic scan with various checks that are suitable to be used against various target types.  
• Credentialed Patch Audit: Authenticated scan that enumerates missing patches.  
• Web Application Tests: Specialized scan for discovering published vulnerabilities in Web Applications.  
• Spectre and Meltdown: Targeted scan for the _Spectre_ and _Meltdown_ vulnerabilities.  

By default, the Basic Network Scan will only scan the common ports.  
To change this, we click the Discovery link on the left side of the Settings tab.

Two versions:  Nessus Essentials and Nessus Professional.
	The Essentials can only scan 16 different IP addresses, and some templates and functions are not available.

### Install

Download Nessus **.deb** file from their website, verify hash, and install
```bash
cd Downloads

# hash copied from site
echo "b9046fa1de3a1f975c490ca6c39de45dcb47cf6cf7d730d044a8f0d8d658396f Nessus-10.6.4-debian10_amd64.deb" > sha256sum_nessus

sha256sum -c sha256sum_nessus
	Nessus-10.6.4-debian10_amd64.deb: OK

sudo apt install ./Nessus-10.56.4-debian10_amd64.deb
```

### Start service
```bash
sudo systemctl start nessusd.service

# In browser
https://127.0.0.1:8834
```
	Need to hit Advanced > Accept the Risk and Continue

### Nessus Components

Nessus takes awhile to setup - esp plugin compiling.

![](nessus_start.png)
	Settings allows application configuration ranging from user interface, scan and log behavior, to security and performance related options.
	Scans shows current/ past scans and allows setting of scan templates and configuration of Policies
		- Policies:  Sets of predefined configuration objects in the context of a Nessus scan.  Can save a Policy to use as a template.


##### New Scan:
![](nessus_templates.png)
	\*\*The _Compliance_ category is only available in the enterprise version as well as the _Mobile Device Scan_ template.


Nessus also provides three general vulnerability scanning templates:

- The Basic Network Scan performs a full scan with the majority of settings predefined. It will detect a broad variety of vulnerabilities and is therefore the recommended scanning template by Nessus. We also have the option to customize these settings and recommendations.

- The Advanced Scan is a template without any predefined settings. We can use this when we want to fully customize our vulnerability scan or if we have specific needs.

- The last general scanning template, Advanced Dynamic Scan, also comes without any predefined settings or recommendations. The biggest difference between the two templates is that in the Advanced Dynamic Scan, we don't need to select plugins manually. The template allows us to configure a dynamic plugin filter instead.

Nessus Plugins are programs written in the Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL) that contain the information and the algorithm to detect vulnerabilities. Each plugin is assigned to a plugin family, which covers different use cases. We will work with the Advanced Dynamic Scan template and plugins in the last section of this Learning Unit.

### Performing a Scan

Click New Scan & pick from Template (like *Basic Network Scan*)

Under *General Settings*, set name, targets, and save location:
![](nessus_scan_settings.png)


##### Specific ports set under *Discovery Settings > Custom Scan Type*:
![](nessus_port_scan.png)

To save time, we'll turn *Host Discovery*'s Ping off as we know the endpoints are up:
![](nessus_ping_off.png)

As no creds were configured, we're running an unauthenticated scan.

Also, as default *Assessment* settings were used, user cred brute forcing will not be done.


To run the scan:  Click arrow next to Save > Launch

### Analyzing Results

##### Scan results:
![](nessus_scan_results.png)

Clicking on *Vulnerabilities* tab shows overall vulns discovered.

##### Clicking on an IP, takes you to that endpoint's vulns:
![](nessus_ip_results.png)

\*\* Mixed severity is used when findings are grouped together (Can be disabled!)

##### Selected grouped vuln:
![](nessus_grouped_vuln.png)


##### Selected specific vuln:
![](nessus_apache_vuln.png)


##### VPR

Vulnerability Priority Rating.    May not be there based on Nessus version, but lists vulns in order of Priority

![](nessus_vpr.png)


#### Remediations:

![](nessus_remediations.png)


#### Sitemap:

In order to create a sitemap when scanning a web server:

Assessment > Custom > Web Apps > Scan web applications
![](nessus_sitemap.png)


### Authenticated scans

Create New Scan for Cred Patch Audit:
![](nessus_cred_scan.png)

Set SSH settings:
![](nessus_cred_settings.png)

While we can also use SSH on Windows, in most cases, we will use [_Server Message Block_ (SMB)](Tools.md#SMB%20Enumeration) and _Windows Management Instrumentation_ (WMI) to perform authenticated vulnerability scans against Windows targets.

Both methods allow us to use local or domain accounts and different authentication options.

Make sure no firewalls are blocking connections from scanner & no AV blocks scans.  UAC can also block scans.

### Plugins

Selecting **Adv Dynamic Scan**

Pick Plugins tab > Enter CVE > Click Preview Plugins & wait.   Will offer Plugin family to pick.  Launch.
	Clicking on the plugin will give pop-up w/ description.
