Some supported scan types:  
• Basic Network Scan: Generic scan with various checks that are suitable to be used against various target types.  
• Credentialed Patch Audit: Authenticated scan that enumerates missing patches.  
• Web Application Tests: Specialized scan for discovering published vulnerabilities in Web Applications.  
• Spectre and Meltdown: Targeted scan for the _Spectre_ and _Meltdown_ vulnerabilities.  

By default, the Basic Network Scan will only scan the common ports.  
To change this, we click the Discovery link on the left side of the Settings tab.

Two versions:  Nessus Essentials and Nessus Professional.
	The Essentials can only scan 16 different IP addresses, and some templates and functions are not available.

### Nessus Components

Nessus takes awhile to setup - esp plugin compiling.

![](nessus_start.png)
	Settings allows application configuration ranging from user interface, scan and log behavior, to security and performance related options.
	Scans shows current/ past scans and allows setting of scan templates and configuration of Policies
		- Policies:  Sets of predefined configuration objects in the context of a Nessus scan.  Can save a Policy to use as a template.

	\*\*The _Compliance_ category is only available in the enterprise version as well as the _Mobile Device Scan_ template.


Nessus also provides three general vulnerability scanning templates:

- The Basic Network Scan performs a full scan with the majority of settings predefined. It will detect a broad variety of vulnerabilities and is therefore the recommended scanning template by Nessus. We also have the option to customize these settings and recommendations.

- The Advanced Scan is a template without any predefined settings. We can use this when we want to fully customize our vulnerability scan or if we have specific needs.

- The last general scanning template, Advanced Dynamic Scan, also comes without any predefined settings or recommendations. The biggest difference between the two templates is that in the Advanced Dynamic Scan, we don't need to select plugins manually. The template allows us to configure a dynamic plugin filter instead.

Nessus Plugins are programs written in the Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL) that contain the information and the algorithm to detect vulnerabilities. Each plugin is assigned to a plugin family, which covers different use cases. We will work with the Advanced Dynamic Scan template and plugins in the last section of this Learning Unit.
