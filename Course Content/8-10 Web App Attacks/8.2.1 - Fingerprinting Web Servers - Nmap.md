We should start web application enumeration from its core component, the web server, since this is the common denominator of any web application that exposes its services.

Whenever a web server is discovered through enumeration, using [Nmap's](Tools.md#nmap) **-sV** switch can grab important banner information:
```bash
sudo nmap -sV -p 80 192.168.50.20
	Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-03-29 05:13 EDT
	Nmap scan report for 192.168.50.20
	Host is up (0.11s latency).
	
	PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
	80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
```

Use of service specific NSE enumeration scripts:
```bash
sudo nmap -p80 --script=http-enum 192.168.50.20
	Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-03-29 06:30 EDT
	Nmap scan report for 192.168.50.20
	Host is up (0.10s latency).
	
	PORT   STATE SERVICE
	80/tcp open  http
	| http-enum:
	|   /login.php: Possible admin folder
	|   /db/: BlogWorx Database
	|   /css/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.41 (ubuntu)'
	|   /db/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.41 (ubuntu)'
	|   /images/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.41 (ubuntu)'
	|   /js/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.41 (ubuntu)'
	|_  /uploads/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.41 (ubuntu)'
