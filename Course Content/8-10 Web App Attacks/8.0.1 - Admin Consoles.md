Simplest “exploit” is to use default username/ password combos, enumerated info to guess working creds, or brute force.  
  
**CAUTION**: Brute force can trigger account lockouts or alert blue teams  
  
Easy to use [BurpSuite](BurpSuite.md) to attempt brute forcing creds

Some things to consider when attempting to bypass login prompts:
Like below, login forms can include tokens to prevent brute forcing and other attacks.  
  
We can also see that the form sets a _set_session_ parameter which is unique for each request.  
- If we change the _set_session_ parameter or _token_ parameter and they don't match the values of the _phpMyAdmin_ cookie, the site will return an error:
![[login_token.png]]
- We can use BurpSuite's Intruder to overcome this protective measure & ensure the values match.
