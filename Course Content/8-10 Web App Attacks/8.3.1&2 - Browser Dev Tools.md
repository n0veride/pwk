  
## Inspecting URLs
Files extensions can reveal programming language.  
  
Ex:  
Java-based: .jsp, .do, or .html  

## Routes
Files extensions on web pages are becoming less common since many languages and frameworks now support the concept of _routes_  
- Allows devs to map a URI to a section of code.  
- Apps leveraging _routes_ use logic to determine what content is returned to the user and make URI extensions largely irrelevant  

  
# Inspecting Page Content

Most context clues can be found in the source of the web page.

\*Ctrl+Shift K - open Web Dev menu.  
  
## Debugger tool
\*Sources in Chrome

May display JS frameworks, hidden input fields, comments, client-side controls w/in HTML, etc.

![](debugger.png)
- megacorpone.com uses jQuery v1.11.0
- "prettify" minified code by clicking on Pretty Print Source button - {}  
  
## Inspector tool
*\Elements in Chrome

Can drill down to specific page content & finding hidden form fields in the HTML source
	\*Rt-click on form field > Inspect

# Inspecting Response Headers & Sitemaps

We can use proxies to intercept requests and responses between a client and webserver, but w/in the browser is the _Network tool_  

## Network tool
- Shows network traffic after a page is launched (may require a refresh)  

Clicking on a ‘server’ header often reveals the name of the software used and its version number (in default configs)  
![](header.png)
Headers that start with “X-” are non-standard headers and often reveal additional info about the tech stack used.  
Ex:
- X-Powered-By
- X-Redirect-By
- x-amz-cf-id
	- indicates app uses Amazon CloudFront
- X-Aspnet-Version

## Inspecting Sitemaps

Sitemap files help search engine spiders crawl (or not crawl) and index sites
- robots.txt  
- sitemap.xml  
  
They can offer key information about allowed/ disallowed web pages that might not otherwise show up upon a visual scan of the site  

In most cases, the listed pages and directories may not be interesting, and some may even be invalid.
Nevertheless, sitemap files should not be overlooked because they may contain clues about the website layout or other interesting information, such as yet-unexplored portions of the target.
  
###### Locating Admin Consoles  
Web servers often ship w/ remote admin apps which are accessible via a specific URL listening on a specific TCP port.  
  
Two common Ex:  
- Tomcat - /manager/html  
- PHP - /phpmyadmin
