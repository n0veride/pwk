- Crucial to identify potential users to target & gather as much detailed info as possible about their OS & installed apps.
	- Improves chances of successful attacks
	- Can ID users by browsing company site and social media
- Often don't have direct connection to the target


# Passive Info Gathering
- Best-suited for situations in which we have no way to interact with the target.
- Since we are not interacting with the target, we won't alert monitoring systems or leave forensic traces of our inquiry. 

### Inspect metadata tags
- Metadata of publicly-available docs may be manually sanitized, but is often not
- Includes a variety of info:
	- Author
	- Creation date
	- Name & version of software used in doc creation
	- System OS
	- etc
- Can be explicit or inferred
- Can help build software profile
- Can be outdated
- Can use Google Dorks like **site:example.com filetype:pdf** or download a file from their site and use [**exiftool**](Tools.md#exiftool)

## Client Fingerprinting
- Info collected about the software and hardware of a remote computing device for the purpose of identification.  
- Extremely critical to success of our attack.  
	- Must often attain from the machine itself  
- Can be used to fully or partially ID individual devices even when:
	- persistent (and zombie) cookies can't be read or stored in the browser
	- the client IP is hidden
	- one switches to another browser on the same device.  
- May allow a service provider to detect & prevent ID theft & CC fraud
	- but also compiles long-term records of individuals' browsing histories for targeted advertising or targeted exploits.  

### [Canarytokens](https://canarytokens.com/generate)
- Free web service that generates a link with an embedded token
	- When opened by client, reports back info on browser, IP, OS.

1. Select type of token
	- Web bug/ URL token
	- (Also available:  DNS token, AWS keys, Word/ Excel Doc, etc)
1. Enter email address or webhook URL
	 - hxxps://example\[.]com
2. Enter a reminder note for when it's triggered
	 - Fingerprinting

Once the Canarytoken is created
- Copy the resulting URL
- Deliver it
	- Email (w/ different name attached - think pretext like... link to a site about dogs when targeting a dog lover)
		- Blank page is served instead
	- As an image (e.g. <img src\="...">)
		- 1x1 image is served
- Manage Token (upper right corner of site)
	- Allows us to set Webhook reporting and Browser scanner settings
- History will show all visitors who clicked on the link & the info about the victim's system.

[fingerprintjs2](Tools.md#fingerprintjs2)'s JS library:  
```bash
cd /var/www/html  
mkdir fp  
  
wget https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2/archive/master.zip  
unzip master.zip  
mv fingerprintjs2-master/ fp  
  
cd fp  
  
vim index.html

We can craft a [website](Tools.md#fingerprintjs2) that, once visited, will gather all the data.  
  
Once a victim browses to the site, we can inspect the contents of **fingerprint.txt** on our attack server  
  
We can submit the discovered User Agent string to an online user agent database to ID the browser version & the OS  
  
UA database: [https://developers.whatismybrowser.com](https://developers.whatismybrowser.com)


Can google for various known external corporate IP addresses.  
See if any are on a site that hosts collected user agent data from various affiliate sites.

	Revealed browser type, version, installed plugins, & underlying OS version of the corporate client machine.  
  
We can then mod & test an existing exploit against on of our lab machines running the same OS & browser version before initiating an attack.  
This info can be found fairly easily even on social media and forum websites. (engineer posting to Stack Overflow about an app version they're having probs w/)  

### Active Info Gathering
  
Involves making direct contact w/ the machine or its users:  
Phone calls  
Phishing emails, etc  

### Social Engineering
  
Tactics to improve chances for attack success.  
  
**Pretexting:** Creating and using an invented scenario to engage the targeted victim in a manner that  
increases the chance they'll divulge info or perform actions that would be unlikely in normal/ ordinary circumstances.  
  
Ex: You send a malformed word doc (resume) to someone in HR.  
They email back saying they can't open it, so you mention it could be a version incompatibility, maybe ask about security features.  
(That there are Adv features like Macros to make it stand out & easy to navigate.)  
They tell you the version of Word they're using.  
You can now craft another doc w/ malicious macros that'll get you a reverse shell.
