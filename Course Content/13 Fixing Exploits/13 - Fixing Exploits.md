It's important to note that most exploits will need to be modified to fit our needs.  
  
Picking an exploit written against the correct service & OS version can protect against an application crash.  
  
Always read the exploit code carefully!!  
  
May also benefit porting an exploit to a different language in order to include addt. pre-written libraries and extend the functionality by importing to an attack framework.  
  
  
[Fixing Memory Exploits](13.1%20-%20Memory%20Corruption.md) (such as BO's)  
- Can be complex and difficult to modify  
	- Not only replace file paths, IPs, ports, URLs, possibly shellcode  
		- Some shellcode is required for exploit to work & needs to be reverse engineered to determine its safety  
	- Also likely need to clone target env in a VM and use debugger to verify/ mod return address & offsets.
