### Cornell Method

Developed by a Cornell University Professor named Walter Pauk in the 1950s. This method involves using a pen and paper, which helps with dual coding.

The first step is to divide the page into three areas. These are the cue (on the left hand side of the page), the notes (the large area on the right hand side of the page), and the summary (several lines of space at the bottom of the page).

	Cue:  Questions we have about the text or key words or phrases
	Notes:  Should be directly related to the items in the cue section.

### Retrieval Practice

Practice of determining whether or not information can be recalled.  We can think of this simply as quizzing yourself.

Ex:   The _Leitner System_[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/effective-learning-strategies/tactics-and-common-methods/retrieval-practice#fn3)
	- Named for German scientist Sebastian Leitner
	- Involves making flashcards as a method to review and repeat learning.
	- Both the act of creating and then practicing with flashcards can be incredibly useful (Dual coding)

### Spaced Practice

Spreads out the study time over days and weeks rather than do it all at once.

Long, "cramming"-style study sessions actually take more time, often come at the expense of sleep, and (because they overwhelm our cognitive load) are significantly less effective.

### SQ3R Method

Follows a pattern of study activities - survey, question, read, recite, review.
- Very similar to the _PQ4R method_,[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/effective-learning-strategies/tactics-and-common-methods/the-sq3r-method#fn2) which is useful for reading comprehension.

Begin by surveying the Module, or reviewing a high level outline, scanning through the material that might be covered during the study session.
In particular, it would be important to review any highlighted text, diagrams, and headings.

Ex: In the case of our current Module, you might encounter the various headings and subheadings: Learning Theory, Unique Challenges to Learning Technical Skills, Offsec Training Methodology, and so on. They might then review the subheadings.

Next, create, preferably in writing, a list of questions you hope to have answered via the material.
This may or may not reflect what the material will actually cover, but should be based largely on the survey.
This is a very important step, as learners will return to the questions repeatedly.

Next, the learner reads the material one section at a time.
If there are videos or other activities for this section, they can also complete those.

Next, the learner returns to their list of questions for that smaller section.
They should try and recite the questions back from memory and determine if they're now able to answer them.

Finally, in the review, a learner returns to all of the smaller sections from a larger Module or chapter to check whether or not the questions have been answered and they can recall the answers.

For learners who have been taught that note taking is simply "writing down things that seem important", the SQ3R method represents an alternative that is much more effective.

### Feynman Technique

1. Learn a Module
2. Explain it to a beginner
3. Identify gaps
4. Return to study

The key is to explain it to someone who is unfamiliar to the concepts learned.

The explanation itself isn't as important as the work the brain has to do to wrestle with the concepts and make them understandable outside of jargon.

Similarly, when it's very difficult for us to break something down in this manner, that may be a sign that we don't understand it very well yet ourselves.
All of this work helps us increase our own understanding.
