> A Windows Service is a long-running background executable or application managed by the Service Control Manager and is similar to the concept of daemons on Unix systems.
> Windows services can be managed by the Services snap-in, PowerShell, or the **sc.exe** command line tool.
> Windows uses the LocalSystem (includes the SIDs of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and BUILTIN\Administrators in its token), Network Service, and Local Service user accounts to run its own services.
> Users or programs creating a service can choose either one of those accounts, a domain user, or a local user.
