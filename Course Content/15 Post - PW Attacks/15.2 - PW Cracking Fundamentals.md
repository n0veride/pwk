# Calculate the cracking time of a hash

Before we begin cracking passwords, let's calculate the cracking time of various hash representations.
The cracking time can be calculated by dividing the ***keyspace*** with the hash rate.

The ***keyspace*** consists of the character set to the power of the amount of characters or length of the original information (password).
- For example, if we use the lower-case Latin alphabet (26 characters), upper case alphabet (26 characters), and the numbers from 0 to 9 (10 characters), we have a character set of 62 possible variations for every character. If we are faced with a five-character password, we are facing 62 to the power of five possible passwords containing these five characters

Calculating crack time
```bash
# Calculate the keyspace  for a 5 char pw using all lowercase, uppercase, and 0-9 digits (62 possible chars per pw char position)
python3 -c "print(62**5)"
	916132832

# Calculate the hash rate
hashcat -b
