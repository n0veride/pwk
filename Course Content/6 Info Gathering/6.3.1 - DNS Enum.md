When misconfigured by admins, anyone can request a copy of the DNS server zone file. The _Zone File_ contains a list of all the DNS names configured for that zone.  
Equivalent to gaining a network layout of a corporation w/ names, addresses, and functionality of their servers.  
Worse misconfiguration is not separating internal DNS namespaces from external DNS namespaces into separate, unrelated zones. Allows for complete map of entire network structure.  
  
Using **-l** option with the [host](OS%20Commands.md#host)  
```bash
host -l megacorpone.com ns1.megacorpone.com
	Using domain server:  
	Name: ns1.megacorpone.com  
	Address: 51.79.37.18#53  
	Aliases:   
	  
	Host megacorpone.com not found: 2(SERVFAIL)  
	; Transfer failed.
```

-------- Means it's configured correctly and will not allow zone transfers.
