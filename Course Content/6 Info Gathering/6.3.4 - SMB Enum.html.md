NetBIOS service listens on TCP port 139 & other UDP ports.  
Though NetBIOS and SMB are two separate protocols and modern implementations of SMB can work w/o NetBIOS, _NetBIOS over TCP_ (NBT) is requred for backwards compatibility and often enabled togther.  
  
Enumeration for both services go hand-in-hand:  
```bash
nmap -v -p 139,445 -oG smb.txt 10.11.1.1-245
```

  
  
[nbtscan](nbtscan.md) - More specialized tool used for specifically id'ing NetBIOS information  
  
[nmap](Tools.md#nmap) - has tons of NSE scripts located in _/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb*_  
	• **-smb-os-discovery**  
	• **-smb-vuln-ms08-067 --script-args=unsafe=1**  
		◇ w/ Script parameter set to **unsafe=1**, the scripts that run are almost/ totally guaranteed to crash a vulnerable system. Use extreme caution when enabling this arg.  
  
[enum4linux](enum4linux.md) - Enumerates through Windows and Samba systems -- Highly recommend outputting to a file  
  
  
Tools used: [smbclient](smbclient.md) and [rpcclient](rpcclient.md)
