_**[nmap](nmap.md)**_ for port scanning and network sweeping.  
  
Network sweeping w/ the **-sn** (ping sweep) option, the host discovery process consists of sending:  
• TCP SYN packet to port 443  
• TCP ACK packet to port 80  
• ICMP timestamp request  
  
Best to output results to a greppable format using **-oG** to a file  
Scanning a specific port/s across a network tends to be more accurate than a ping sweep (**-sn**)  
  
Save time and resources, scan multiple IPs for top ports:  
```bash
nmap -sT -A --top-ports=20 10.11.1.1-254 -oG top-port-sweep.txt
```
	**-sT** - Connect scan  
	**-A** - Aggressive scan: OS detection, traceroute, script scanning  
	**--top-ports** - Scans for given number (20) of top ports (determined within _/usr/share/nmap/nmap-services_)  
  
_**OS Fingerprinting**_ attempts to guess the target's OS version by inspecting return packets as OS's have slightly different implementations of their TCP/IP stack.  
Not always accurate - more like a best guess  
  
_**[Banner Grabbing](Banner_Grabbing.md)**_ _can_ help ID services by inspecting banners (use w/ **-sT -A**), however, as banners can be manipulated by sysadmins, beware w/ fake info.  
Has a significant impact on traffic amounts, so use wisely.
