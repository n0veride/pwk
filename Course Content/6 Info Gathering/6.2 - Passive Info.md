### **OSINT** - Open Source Intelligence:
	Process of collecting openly-available information about a target, generally without any direct interaction with that target

Strictest interpretation:
	*Never* communicated with the target directly.
	Relies on 3rd parties for informations
	Doesn't allow access of a target's systems or servers
 
Looser interpretation:
	Might interact, but only as a normal internet user (i.e. Register for an account, but not test for vulns)


\*Consider scope and RoE before considering which approach to use.

The ultimate goal of passive information gathering is to obtain information that clarifies or expands an attack surface, helping to conduct a successful phishing campaign, or supplementing other penetration testing steps such as password guessing, which can ultimately lead to account compromise.
	Ex: discovering (via a random blog post) an employee is looking to collect rare stamps, manufacturing a rare stamp site, and engaging the employee to interact with the site which allowed embedded malicious code to run thereby giving a reverse shell on the employee's computer.


### [whois](Tools.md#whois)

We can gather basic information about a domain name by executing a standard forward search and passing the domain name (DN), _megacorpone.com_, into **whois**, providing the IP address of our Ubuntu WHOIS server as an argument of the host (**-h**) parameter.

```bash
whois megacorpone.com -h 192.168.50.251
   Domain Name: MEGACORPONE.COM
   Registry Domain ID: 1775445745_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN

```
	Important bits to note are highlighted in green


Assuming we have an IP address as well, we can also use the **whois** client to perform a Reverse Lookup and get even more info:
```bash
whois 38.100.193.70 -h 192.168.50.251
...
NetRange:       '38.0.0.0 - 38.255.255.255'
CIDR:           '38.0.0.0/8'
NetName:        COGENT-A
...
OrgName:        PSINet, Inc.

```
	Looking at this info, we can see the CIDR info


### [Google Dorks](Tools.md#Google%20Dorks)

Using creative refinement of search queries to uncover critical information, vulnerabilities, and misconfigured websites.  
Can find more w/ the [Google Hacking Database GHDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) 
Also, a good site w/ pre-built searches:   [Dork Search portal](https://dorksearch.com/)
  
###### **-**
Used to exclude. Great for viewing non-HTML pages  
  
###### **site**:
Limits searches to a single domain. Can be used to get an idea of an org's web presence.

Great way to search for subdomains of a site while ignoring *www*.  
```bash
site:*.megacorpone.com -site:www.megacorpone.com
```

###### **filetype** or **ext**:
Limits searches to a specified file type.
```bash
site:megacorpone.com filetype:php
```

The **ext** operator could also be helpful to discern what programming languages might be used on a web site.  
Searches like **ext:jsp**, **ext:cfm**, **ext:pl** will find indexed Java Server Pages, Coldfusion, and Perl pages respectively.  

###### **intitle**:
Finds pages with given words or strings in them.  
```bash
intitle:“index of” “parent directory”
```
	Shows results w/ “index of” in the title and “parent directory” somewhere on the page.  
File contents of directories without index pages.  
Able to find interesting files and sensitive info through these misconfigurations.

### [Netcraft](Tools.md#Netcraft)

Free web portal that performs various information gathering functions such as discovering which technologies are running on a given website and finding which other hosts share the same IP netblock, etc.

Enter the domain and select Site Report:
![[netcraft.png|700]]

Section of a report:
![[netcraft_report.png|700]]


### Open-Source Code

Includes open-source projects and online code repositories such as GitHub, GitHub, Gist, GitLab, and SourceForge.

Can provide a glimpse into the programming languages and frameworks used.
Can also be a source for committed sensitive data and creds.
Works best on small repos

To search GitHub, we can use our own account and perform multiple keyword-based searches using the search field.

To search MegaCorpOne's GitHub for any files with the word 'user':
![](github_search.png)

Viewing that file gives us a leaked, committed hash:
![](github_creds.png)

#### [GitLeaks](Tools.md#GitLeaks) & [GitRob](Tools.md#GitRob])

Best for larger repos, but may still miss out on things better found manually as they generally rely on regex or entropy-based detections
Likely require an access token to use the source code-hosting provider's API.

### [Shodan.io](Tools.md#Shodan%29io)

Search engine that crawls devices connected to the internet.    Can show open ports, vulnerabilities, web technologies, etc.
Can use filters when searching:
```bash
hostname:megacorpone.com
port:"22"
```

![[shodan.png|800]]

### Security Headers & SSL/TLS

There are sites available that gather info about a site or domain's security posture.
#### [Security Headers](Tools.md#Security%20Headers) & [SSL Server Test](Tools.md#SSL%20Labs)

Are two sites that can clue you in on the security posture of an org's web domain.

Security Headers will analyze HTTP Response headers for misconfigurations which may signal potential attack vectors for a webapp pentest

SSL Server Test analyzes a server's SSL/TLS configuration and compares it w/ best practices.


### Removed from coursework

#### [recon-ng](Tools.md#recon%28ng)

Module based framework for web-based OSINT.  Displays results to terminal and saves to a database which can feed into other modules. 

#### [pastebin](https://pastebin.com)

Used for storing and sharing text. Search was removed, so have to use google dorks for results

#### [theHarvester](Tools.md#theHarvester)

Gather email OSINT on company or domain. Useful for email harvesting. (got version 3.2.3 working on Parrot, but not 4.0.0 on Kali. bing works better on Kali v4.0.3) 

**-d** - Searches given domain  
**-b** - Utilizes given source (ie: google, baidu, twitter, etc) Needs API for some sources  
**-g** - Uses Google Dorks  
**-s** - Utilizes Shodan

#### [social-searcher](https://www.social-searcher.com)

Social media search engine
Search across social media for keywords and users

#### [haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites)

Contains info on breached websites.

#### [twofi](Tools.md#twofi)

Scans a user's Twitter feed and generates a personalized wordlist used for password attacks against that user.  
Requires valid Twitter API key  
  
[digi.ninja/projects/twofi.php](http://digi.ninja/projects/twofi.php)

#### [linkedin2username](Tools.md#linkedin2username)

Script for generating username lists based on LinkedIn data.  
Requires valid LinkedIn creds and depends on a connection to individuals in the target org.  
  
[github.com/inistring/linkedin2username](http://github.com/inistring/linkedin2username)

#### [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com)

Includes info gathering tools and websites in one central location 

#### [maltego](https://www.maltego.com/maltego-community/)

Powerful data mining tool that uses “transforms” that takes a bit of data (ex: email address) and links it w/ other associated data (ex: phone number, street add, etc)
