### **OSINT** - Open Source Intelligence:
	Process of collecting openly-available information about a target, generally without any direct interaction with that target

Strictest interpretation:
	*Never* communicated with the target directly.
	Relies on 3rd parties for informations
	Doesn't allow access of a target's systems or servers
 
Looser interpretation:
	Might interact, but only as a normal internet user (i.e. Register for an account, but not test for vulns)


\*Consider scope and RoE before considering which approach to use.

The ultimate goal of passive information gathering is to obtain information that clarifies or expands an attack surface, helping to conduct a successful phishing campaign, or supplementing other penetration testing steps such as password guessing, which can ultimately lead to account compromise.
	Ex: discovering (via a random blog post) an employee is looking to collect rare stamps, manufacturing a rare stamp site, and engaging the employee to interact with the site which allowed embedded malicious code to run thereby giving a reverse shell on the employee's computer.


### [whois](whois.md)

We can gather basic information about a domain name by executing a standard forward search and passing the domain name (DN), _megacorpone.com_, into **whois**, providing the IP address of our Ubuntu WHOIS server as an argument of the host (**-h**) parameter.

```bash
whois megacorpone.com -h 192.168.50.251
   Domain Name: MEGACORPONE.COM
   Registry Domain ID: 1775445745_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN

	Important bits to note are highlighted in green


Assuming we have an IP address as well, we can also use the **whois** client to perform a Reverse Lookup and get even more info:
```bash
whois 38.100.193.70 -h 192.168.50.251
...
NetRange:       '38.0.0.0 - 38.255.255.255'
CIDR:           '38.0.0.0/8'
NetName:        COGENT-A
...

```
	Looking at this info, we can see the CIDR info
