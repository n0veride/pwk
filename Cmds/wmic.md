Utility that provides access to the _Windows Management Instrumentation_, which is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows.  
  
*One important thing to keep in mind is that the product WMI class only lists applications that are installed by the _Windows Installer_.  
It will not list applications that do not use the Windows Installer.


**process list <brief / full>** - Displays either brief or fully detailed information about a (or multiple) running process(es)

**get	<name, parentprocessid, processid, commandline ,etc>** - Displays information for specific fields

**where processid=<\pid> get <\field>** - Focus on a specific process; can use any(?) field header such as **description="<\desc name>"**

**startup <list brief / full>** - Examine either brief or fully detailed information about startup items

**delete** -	Deletes the process

| /ROLE        | The namespace that WMIC typically looks in for aliases and other WMIC information. When the role changes, the WMIC interactive command prompt changes to match the role.
