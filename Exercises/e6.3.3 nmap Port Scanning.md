1. Start Walk Through Exercises in VM Group #1, use Nmap to conduct a SYN stealth scan of your target IP range, and save the output to a file.
	Use grep to show machines that are online. Which host has port 25 open?
	Use _50_ as the third IP octet instead of your dynamically assigned IP when submitting the answer.
```bash
sudo nmap -sS -p 25 192.168.195.1-254 -oG 25scan.txt
grep open 25scan.txt | cut -d " " -f 2
```
> Answer:   192.168.50.8


2. Perform an Nmap TCP scan against the addresses on the Walk Through Exercises on VM Group #1.
   Which host is running a WHOIS server?
	   Use _50_ as the third IP octet instead of your dynamically assigned IP when submitting the answer.
```bash
# lookup whois server port
sudo nmap -sS -p 43 192.168.195.1-254 -oG whois.txt
grep open whois.txt | cut -d " " -f 2
```
> Answer:   192.168.50.251


3. Connect via RDP to the Windows 11 client from Walk Through Exercises VM Group #1 and perform TCP port discovery against the Windows DC machine ending with the octet '151' (ex: 192.168.51.151).
	   Which are the first four open TCP ports? List the ports separated by commas.
```bash
rdesktop 192.168.195.152 -u student -p lab
```

```powershell
powershell
1..1024 | % {echo ((New-Object Net.Sockets.TcpClient).Connect("192.168.195.151", $_)) "TCP port $_ is open"} 2>$null
```

4. There is a service running on a high-range TCP port on the Module Exercises VM #1.
	   Find it, and you will find the flag together with it.
```bash
# find highest ports quickly
sudo nmap -p- -Pn --max-scan-delay=0 192.168.195.52
	PORT      STATE SERVICE
	22/tcp    open  ssh
	2222/tcp  open  EtherNetIP-1
	59811/tcp open  unknown

# perform a service version scan on the top port
sudo nmap -sV -p 59811 192.168.195.52
```

5. The NMAP Scripting Engine includes a many extremely useful scripts to assist in the active recon process for a wide variety of things, not just the handful of services discussed in this Module. In the NMAP library, for example, there are over 100 NSE discovery scripts. For this challenge, you will need to use a new discovery script to help you enumerate the _HTTP title_ of the default page of all the hosts with web servers on the public lab network. Performing something as simple as scanning the web server titles can help you collect all sorts of information about the target, including the purpose of the website, software version information, and even login pages. In this challenge, you need to find the host with a web server with the title "Under Construction" in the Module Exercises VM Group 1. The flag is located on the **index.html** page of the web server matching this title.
```bash
# find NSE script for http title
grep http /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db | grep title
	Entry { filename = "http-title.nse", categories = { "default", "discovery", "safe", } }

# run scan on IP range using NSE http headers script
# -oG won't display NSE results, therefore won't work with grep.  output to file using >
sudo nmap --script http-title 192.168.195.1-254 > http_title.txt

# search for desired title, displaying 6 lines before found title.
grep "Under Construction" -B 6 http_title.txt
	Nmap scan report for 192.168.195.6
	Host is up (0.076s latency).
	Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
	PORT   STATE SERVICE
	22/tcp open  ssh
	80/tcp open  http
	|_http-title: Under Construction

# get index.html
curl 192.168.195.6:80/index.html
```
