2. Repeat the steps we covered in this Learning Unit and enumerate the targets via Nmap, Wappayzer and Gobuster by starting _Walkthrough VM 1_. When performing a file/directory brute force attack with Gobuster, what is the HTTP response code related to redirection?

```bash
#enumerate targets
sudo nmap -sV 192.168.228.16
	...
	PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
	22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
	80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.51 ((Debian))
	Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
	...

#run http enum script on port
sudo nmap -p 80 --script=http-enum 192.168.228.16
	...
	PORT   STATE SERVICE
	80/tcp open  http
	| http-enum: 
	|   /blog/: Blog
	|   /weblog/: Blog
	|   /weblogs/: Blog

	Error: the server returns a status code that matches the provided options for non existing urls. http://192.168.228.16/29da29db-e701-468f-93fc-7bccf56bd14c => 301 (Length: 0). To continue please exclude the status code or the length
```

> Answer:  301



4. We have a lot of mess on our hands, and the new _DIRTBUSTER_ cleaning service is just what we need to help with the cleanup! You can visit their new site on the Module Exercise VM #1, but it is still under development. We wonder where they hid their admin portal. Once found the admin portal, log-in with the provided credentials **(admin/admin)** to obtain the flag.
```bash
#enumerate directories
gobuster dir -u 192.168.228.52 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
	...
	/.htaccess            (Status: 403) [Size: 279]
	/.htpasswd            (Status: 403) [Size: 279]
	/.hta                 (Status: 403) [Size: 279]
	/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 439]
	/portal               (Status: 301) [Size: 317] [--> http://192.168.228.52/portal/]
	/server-status        (Status: 403) [Size: 279]
	...

#in browser 192.168.228.52/portal
#login with u: admin p: admin
```

5. The DIRTBUSTER team finally changed their default credentials, but they are not very original. We complied at _http://target_vm/passwords.txt_ of potential passwords from the DIRTBUSTER employee contact info - I am confident the password is in there somewhere. The username is still _admin_, and the new login portal is available at the web server root folder on the Module Exercise VM #2.
```bash
#grab list of passwords
curl http://192.168.228.52/passwords.txt > 842pw.txt

#open BurpSuite
#open Firefox
#turn on Burp proxy via FoxyProxy
#navigate to http://192.168.228.52
#login using u: admin / password
# 1. send to Intruder
# 2. load pw file under Intruder's Payload tab
# 3. double click 'password' and AddÂ§ position under Intruder's Positions tab
# 4. start attack
# 5. As all status codes are 200, sort by length!!
