1. Power on the Walk Through VM Group 1 and use Nmap to create a list of the SMB servers in the VM Group 1.
	   How many hosts have port 445 open?
```bash
# run verbose scan on port 445 across IP range, and save to a file
nmap -v -p 445 -oG smb.txt 192.168.214.1-254
# grep for open ports, count lines
grep open smb.txt | wc -l
```

2. On the same group, connect to the Windows 11 client and repeat the shares enumeration against dc01 via the **net view** command.
	What are the three reported admin shares? List them separated by commas.
```bash
# Connect to Win client
rdesktop 192.168.214.152 -u student -p lab
```

```powershell
net view \\dc01 /all
	Shared resources at \\dc01
	Share name  Type  Used as  Comment
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	ADMIN$      Disk           Remote Admin
	C$          Disk           Default share
	IPC$        IPC            Remote IPC
	NETLOGON    Disk           Logon server share
	SYSVOL      Disk           Logon server share
	The command completed successfully.
```

3. Server message block (SMB) is an extremely important service that can be used to determine a wealth of information about a server, including its users.
	Start up _Topic Exercise VM Group 1_ and use Nmap to identify the lab machines listening on the SMB port and then use _enum4linux_ to enumerate those machines.
	In doing so, you will find a machine with the local user _alfred_. The flag is located in the comments on one of the SMB shares of the host that has the _alfred_ user.
```bash
# run verbose scan on port 445 across IP range, and save to a file
nmap -v -p 445 -oG smb_enum.txt 192.168.214.1-254

# create file with only IPs of open SMB ports
grep open smb_enum.txt | cut -d " " -f 2 > smb_targets.txt

# enumerate users w/ enum4linux
for ip in $(cat smb_targets.txt); do enum4linux -U -S $ip; done > enum4linux.txt

# # so, I couldn't find any users (lots of errors, & another had the same problem)
# # ended up adding -S to the command.  The flag was listed w/in the shares on 192.168.214.13
grep Flag enum4linux.txt
```
