1. Once VM Group 1 is started, perform a Netcat scan against the machine ending with the octet '151' (ex: 192.168.51.151) Which is the lowest TCP open port?
```bash
nc -nvv -w 1 -z 192.168.196.151 1-100 |& grep open
	(UNKNOWN) [192.168.196.151] 88 (kerberos) open
	(UNKNOWN) [192.168.196.151] 53 (domain) open
```
	|& = 2>&1.   Allows any stderr to get connected to stdout input through the pipe.

2. On the same host, perform a netcat TCP scan for the port range 1-10000. Which is the highest open TCP port?
```bash
nc -nvv -w 1 -z 192.168.196.151 1-10000 |& grep open
	(UNKNOWN) [192.168.196.151] 9389 (?) open
