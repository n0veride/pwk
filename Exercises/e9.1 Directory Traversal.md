### 9.1.2

1. Follow the steps above and leverage the directory traversal vulnerability in the "Mountain Desserts" web application on VM #1. Use **curl** or _Burp_ to obtain the SSH private key for the user _offsec_. Use it to connect via SSH on port 2222 and find the flag in the SSH banner, which is displayed after you log in.
```bash
curl -i http://offsec/mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../../home/offsec/.ssh/id_rsa
# copy only key part & save in offsec_sshkey file
# tighten up perms on key file
chmod 400 offsec_sshkey
# ssh into machine w/ user's key
ssh -i offsec_sshkey -p 2222 offsec@mountaindesserts.com
```

2. The target VM #2 runs _Grafana_ on port 3000. The service is vulnerable to CVE-2021-43798, which is a directory traversal vulnerability. Search for "golangexample cve-2021-43798" in a search engine to get familiar with how the vulnerability can be exploited. Use **curl** and the **--path-as-is** parameter to find the flag in **C:\\Users\\install.txt**.

### 9.1.3 Encoding Special Characters

1. In this section, we used URL encoding to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability in Apache 2.4.49 on VM #1. Use _Burp_ or **curl** to display the contents of the **/opt/passwords** file via directory traversal in the vulnerable Apache web server. Remember to use URL encoding for the directory traversal attack. Find the flag in the output of the file.

2. Grafana is running on port 3000 on VM #2. The version running is vulnerable to the same directory traversal vulnerability as in the previous section. While URL encoding is not needed to perform a successful directory traversal attack, experiment with URL encoding different characters of your request to display the contents of **/etc/passwd**. Once you have a working request utilizing URL encoding, obtain the flag by displaying the contents of **/opt/install.txt**.
