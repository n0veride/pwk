### nmap Port Scanning


1. Start Walk Through Exercises in VM Group #1, use Nmap to conduct a SYN stealth scan of your target IP range, and save the output to a file.
	Use grep to show machines that are online. Which host has port 25 open?
	Use _50_ as the third IP octet instead of your dynamically assigned IP when submitting the answer.
```bash
sudo nmap -sS -p 25 192.168.195.1-254 -oG 25scan.txt
grep open 25scan.txt | cut -d " " -f 2
```
> Answer:   192.168.50.8


2. Perform an Nmap TCP scan against the addresses on the Walk Through Exercises on VM Group #1.
   Which host is running a WHOIS server?
	   Use _50_ as the third IP octet instead of your dynamically assigned IP when submitting the answer.
```bash
# lookup whois server port
sudo nmap -sS -p 43 192.168.195.1-254 -oG whois.txt

4. There is a service running on a high-range TCP port on the Module Exercises VM #1.
	   Find it, and you will find the flag together with it.
```bash
# find highest ports quickly
sudo nmap -p- -Pn --max-scan-delay=0 192.168.195.52
	PORT      STATE SERVICE
	22/tcp    open  ssh

5. The NMAP Scripting Engine includes a many extremely useful scripts to assist in the active recon process for a wide variety of things, not just the handful of services discussed in this Module. In the NMAP library, for example, there are over 100 NSE discovery scripts. For this challenge, you will need to use a new discovery script to help you enumerate the _HTTP title_ of the default page of all the hosts with web servers on the public lab network. Performing something as simple as scanning the web server titles can help you collect all sorts of information about the target, including the purpose of the website, software version information, and even login pages. In this challenge, you need to find the host with a web server with the title "Under Construction" in the Module Exercises VM Group 1. The flag is located on the **index.html** page of the web server matching this title.
```bash
# find NSE script for http title
grep http /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db | grep title
	Entry { filename = "http-title.nse", categories = { "default", "discovery", "safe", } }

# run scan on IP range using NSE http headers script
# -oG won't display NSE results, therefore won't work with grep.  output to file using >
sudo nmap --script http-title 192.168.195.1-254 > http_title.txt

# search for desired title, displaying 6 lines before found title.
grep "Under Construction" -B 6 http_title.txt
	Nmap scan report for 192.168.195.6
	Host is up (0.076s latency).
	Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
	PORT   STATE SERVICE
	22/tcp open  ssh
	80/tcp open  http
	|_http-title: Under Construction

# get index.html
curl 192.168.195.6:80/index.html

# SMB

1. Power on the Walk Through VM Group 1 and use Nmap to create a list of the SMB servers in the VM Group 1.
	   How many hosts have port 445 open?
```bash
# run verbose scan on port 445 across IP range, and save to a file
nmap -v -p 445 -oG smb.txt 192.168.214.1-254
# grep for open ports, count lines
grep open smb.txt | wc -l
```
> Answer:   10


2. On the same group, connect to the Windows 11 client and repeat the shares enumeration against dc01 via the **net view** command.
	What are the three reported admin shares? List them separated by commas.
```bash
# Connect to Win client
rdesktop 192.168.214.152 -u student -p lab
```

```powershell
net view \\dc01 /all
	Shared resources at \\dc01
	Share name  Type  Used as  Comment

3. Server message block (SMB) is an extremely important service that can be used to determine a wealth of information about a server, including its users.
	Start up _Topic Exercise VM Group 1_ and use Nmap to identify the lab machines listening on the SMB port and then use _enum4linux_ to enumerate those machines.
	In doing so, you will find a machine with the local user _alfred_. The flag is located in the comments on one of the SMB shares of the host that has the _alfred_ user.
```bash
# run verbose scan on port 445 across IP range, and save to a file
nmap -v -p 445 -oG smb_enum.txt 192.168.214.1-254

# create file with only IPs of open SMB ports
grep open smb_enum.txt | cut -d " " -f 2 > smb_targets.txt

# enumerate users w/ enum4linux
for ip in $(cat smb_targets.txt); do enum4linux -U -S $ip; done > enum4linux.txt

# # so, I couldn't find any users (lots of errors, & another had the same problem)
# # ended up adding -S to the command.  The flag was listed w/in the shares on 192.168.214.13
grep Flag enum4linux.txt

# SMTP

1.  Power on the Walk Through Exercises VM Group 1 and search your target network range to identify any systems that respond to SMTP. Once found, open a connection to port 25 via Netcat and run _VRFY_ command against the _root_ user. What reply code does the SMTP server send as a response?
```bash
# Scan for SMPT hosts
nmap -v -p 25 -oG smtp.txt 192.168.195.1-254
grep open smtp.txt
	Host: 192.168.195.8 ()  Ports: 25/open/tcp//smtp///
