1. **Capstone Exercise**: Follow the steps above to perform the vulnerability scan with the custom NSE script on VM #1. 
   Copy the link from the script output after _Verify arbitrary file read:_ and use it as parameter for curl.
   This will retrieve the content of **/etc/passwd** of the target machine and display it.
	   Be aware that you need to use _http_ instead of _https_ while keeping port 443 when you paste the link.
   Embed the last username of the file in the braces of "OS{}" and provide it as answer to this exercise.

	|   Path traversal and file disclosure vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49
	|     State: VULNERABLE
	|               A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the expected document root. If files outside of the document root are not protected by "require all denied" these requests can succeed. Additionally this flaw could leak the source of interpreted files like CGI scripts. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions.
