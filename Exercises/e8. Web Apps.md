# Web App Assessment

2. Repeat the steps we covered in this Learning Unit and enumerate the targets via Nmap, Wappayzer and Gobuster by starting _Walkthrough VM 1_. When performing a file/directory brute force attack with Gobuster, what is the HTTP response code related to redirection?

```bash
#enumerate targets
sudo nmap -sV 192.168.228.16
	...
	PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
	22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
	80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.51 ((Debian))
	Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
	...

#run http enum script on port
sudo nmap -p 80 --script=http-enum 192.168.228.16
	...

	Error: the server returns a status code that matches the provided options for non existing urls. http://192.168.228.16/29da29db-e701-468f-93fc-7bccf56bd14c => 301 (Length: 0). To continue please exclude the status code or the length
```

> Answer:  301



4. We have a lot of mess on our hands, and the new _DIRTBUSTER_ cleaning service is just what we need to help with the cleanup! You can visit their new site on the Module Exercise VM #1, but it is still under development. We wonder where they hid their admin portal. Once found the admin portal, log-in with the provided credentials **(admin/admin)** to obtain the flag.
```bash
#enumerate directories
gobuster dir -u 192.168.228.52 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
	...
	/.htaccess            (Status: 403) [Size: 279]
	/.htpasswd            (Status: 403) [Size: 279]
	/.hta                 (Status: 403) [Size: 279]
	/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 439]
	/portal               (Status: 301) [Size: 317] [--> http://192.168.228.52/portal/]
	/server-status        (Status: 403) [Size: 279]
	...

#in browser 192.168.228.52/portal
#login with u: admin p: admin
```

5. The DIRTBUSTER team finally changed their default credentials, but they are not very original. We complied at _http://target_vm/passwords.txt_ of potential passwords from the DIRTBUSTER employee contact info - I am confident the password is in there somewhere. The username is still _admin_, and the new login portal is available at the web server root folder on the Module Exercise VM #2.
```bash
#grab list of passwords
curl http://192.168.228.52/passwords.txt > 842pw.txt

#open BurpSuite
#open Firefox
#turn on Burp proxy via FoxyProxy
#navigate to http://192.168.228.52
#login using u: admin / password
# 1. send to Intruder
# 2. load pw file under Intruder's Payload tab
# 3. double click 'password' and AddÂ§ position under Intruder's Positions tab
# 4. start attack
# 5. As all status codes are 200, sort by length!!
```

# Web App Enumeration


1. Start up the _Walkthrough VM 1_ and modify the Kali **/etc/hosts** file to reflect the provided dynamically-allocated IP address that has been assigned to the _offsecwp_ instance. Use Firefox to get familiar with the Developer Debugging Tools by navigating to the _offsecwp_ site and replicate the steps shown in this Learning Unit. Explore the entire WordPress website and inspect its HTML source code in order to find the flag.
```bash
#add wp page to /etc/hosts
sudo cat >> /etc/hosts
	192.168.196.16  offsecwp
	#Ctrl D

#in browser
# 1. Navigate to offsecwp
# 2. Ctrl+Shift K
# 3. Go to Debugger tab
# 4. Go through all threads on left
# 5. Search for OS{ on right
```

2. Start _Walkthrough VM 2_ and replicate the curl command we learned in this section in order to map and exploit the vulnerable APIs. Next, perform a brute force attack to discover another API that has a same pattern as **/users/v1**. Then, perform a query against the base path of the new API: what's the name of the item belonging to the _admin_ user?   API is on 5002
```bash
# create API pattern file for gobuster brute forcing
cat > pattern
	{GOBUSTER}/v1
	{GOBUSTER}/v2
	#Ctrl D

# bf w/ gobuster
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.211.16:5002 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -p pattern
	...
	/books/v1             (Status: 200) [Size: 235]
	/console              (Status: 200) [Size: 1985]
	/ui                   (Status: 308) [Size: 267] [--> http://192.168.211.16:5002/ui/]
	/users/v1             (Status: 200) [Size: 316]
	Progress: 81876 / 20470 (399.98%)
	...

# as it states discovering another API similar to /users/v1, query the /books/v1
curl -i http://192.168.211.16:5002/books/v1
	{
	  ...
	  "Books": [
	    ...
	    {
	      "book_title": "bookTitle22", 
	      "user": "admin"
	    }
		...
```
> Answer:  bookTitle22



3. This website running on the Exercise VM 1 is dedicated to all things maps! Follow the maps to get the flag.
```bash
# bf w/ gobuster
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.211.52:80 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -p pattern
	...
	/robots.txt           (Status: 200) [Size: 123]
	/sitemap.xml          (Status: 200) [Size: 579]

5. We made another website, but something is wrong. The site is available at Exercise VM 3, but it keeps giving some weird, non-standard responses. Check out the HTTP headers that accompany this site.
```bash
# navigate to 192.168.211.52
# Ctrl+Shift K to open Dev Tools
# open Network Tab and click on the GET 200 request for the main site
```
![](8.3.3ex_header.png)
```bash
# copy base64 from the header and decrypt
echo "VGhlIGZsYWcgaXM6IE9TezU2Yzg5YzAxNDkzY2YwZGY2OGY2NzkxM2Y5NmNhZDk2fQ==" | base64 -d
	The flag is: OS{56c89c01493cf0df68f67913f96cad96}

6. We made this cool website dedicated to the three web amigos: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is available at the web root on the Exercise VM 4. Closely review each of the three friends to find the flag for this challenge.
```bash
# navigate to 192.168.211.52
# Ctrl+Shift K to open Dev Tools
# open Debugger Tab and click through the various sources waiting for your search of 'flag' to reveal results
```
![](8.3.3ex_sources1.png)
```bash
# open Style Editor
# progress through style sheets searching for 'flag'
```
![](8.3.3ex_sources2.png)
![](8.3.3ex_sources3.png)
```bash
# open Console Tab, refresh page, and run function: displayflag_2265()
```
